Wow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands. So nice, thank you very much. That's really nice. Thank you. It's great to be at Trump Tower. It's great to be in a wonderful city, New York. And it's an honor to have everybody here. This is beyond anybody's expectations. There's been no crowd like this. And, I can tell, some of the candidates, they went in. They didn't know the air conditioner didn't work. They sweated like dogs. They didn't know the room was too big, because they didn't have anybody there. How are they going to beat ISIS? I don't think it's gonna happen. Our country is in serious trouble. We don't have victories anymore. We used to have victories, but we don't have them. When was the last time anybody saw us beating, let's say, China in a trade deal? They kill us. I beat China all the time. All the time. When did we beat Japan at anything? They send their cars over by the millions, and what do we do? When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time. When do we beat Mexico at the border? They're laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they're killing us economically. The US has become a dumping ground for everybody else's problems. Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. But I speak to border guards and they tell us what we're getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. They're sending us not the right people. It's coming from more than Mexico. It's coming from all over South and Latin America, and it's coming probably, probably, from the Middle East. But we don't know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we don't know what's happening. And it's got to stop and it's got to stop fast. Islamic terrorism is eating up large portions of the Middle East. They've become rich. I'm in competition with them. They just built a hotel in Syria. Can you believe this? They built a hotel. When I have to build a hotel, I pay interest. They don't have to pay interest, because they took the oil that, when we left Iraq, I said we should've taken. So now ISIS has the oil, and what they don't have, Iran has. And in 19, and I will tell you this, and I said it very strongly, years ago, I said, and I love the military, and I want to have the strongest military that we've ever had, and we need it more now than ever. But I said, Don't hit Iraq, because you're going to totally destabilize the Middle East. Iran is going to take over the Middle East, Iran and somebody else will get the oil, and it turned out that Iran is now taking over Iraq. Think of it. Iran is taking over Iraq, and they're taking it over big league. We spent $2 trillion in Iraq, $2 trillion. We lost thousands of lives, thousands in Iraq. We have wounded soldiers, who I love, I love, they're great, all over the place, thousands and thousands of wounded soldiers. And we have nothing. We can't even go there. We have nothing. And every time we give Iraq equipment, the first time a bullet goes off in the air, they leave it. Last week, I read 2300 Humvees, these are big vehicles, were left behind for the enemy. 2000? You would say maybe two, maybe four? 2300 sophisticated vehicles, they ran, and the enemy took them. Last quarter, it was just announced our gross domestic product, a sign of strength, right? But not for us. It was below zero. Whoever heard of this? It's never below zero. Our labor participation rate was the worst since 1978. But think of it, GDP below zero, horrible labor participation rate. And our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it. That's right. A lot of people up there can't get jobs. They can't get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs. They all have jobs. But the real number, the real number is anywhere from 18 to 19 and maybe even 21 percent, and nobody talks about it, because it's a statistic that's full of nonsense. Our enemies are getting stronger and stronger by the way, and we as a country are getting weaker. Even our nuclear arsenal doesn't work. It came out recently they have equipment that is 30 years old. They don't know if it worked. And I thought it was horrible when it was broadcast on television, because boy, does that send signals to Putin and all of the other people that look at us and they say, That is a group of people, and that is a nation that truly has no clue. They don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing. We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare. Yesterday, it came out that costs are going for people up 29, 39, 49, and even 55 percent, and deductibles are through the roof. You have to be hit by a tractor, literally, a tractor, to use it, because the deductibles are so high, it's virtually useless. It's virtually useless. It is a disaster. And remember the $5 billion website? $5 billion we spent on a website, and to this day it doesn't work. A $5 billion website. I have so many websites, I have them all over the place. I hire people, they do a website. It costs me $3. $5 billion website. Well, you need somebody, because politicians are all talk, no action. Nothing's gonna get done. They will not bring us, believe me, to the promised land. They will not. As an example, I've been on the circuit making speeches, and I hear my fellow Republicans. And they're wonderful people. I like them. They all want me to support them. They don't know how to bring it about. They come up to my office. I'm meeting with three of them in the next week. And they don't know, Are you running? Are you not running? Could we have your support? What do we do? How do we do it? I like them. And I hear their speeches. And they don't talk jobs and they don't talk China. When was the last time you heard China is killing us? They're devaluing their currency to a level that you wouldn't believe. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete, impossible. They're killing us. But you don't hear that from anybody else. You don't hear it from anybody else. And I watch the speeches. I watch the speeches of these people, and they say the sun will rise, the moon will set, all sorts of wonderful things will happen. And people are saying, What's going on? I just want a job. Just get me a job. I don't need the rhetoric. I want a job. And that's what's happening. And it's going to get worse, because remember, Obamacare really kicks in in '16, 2016. Obama is going to be out playing golf. He might be on one of my courses. I would invite him, I actually would say. I have the best courses in the world, so I'd say, you what, if he wants to, I have one right next to the White House, right on the Potomac. If he'd like to play, that's fine. In fact, I'd love him to leave early and play, that would be a very good thing. But Obamacare kicks in in 2016. Really big league. It is going to be amazingly destructive. Doctors are quitting. I have a friend who's a doctor, and he said to me the other day, Donald, I never saw anything like it. I have more accountants than I have nurses. It's a disaster. My patients are beside themselves. They had a plan that was good. They have no plan now. We have to repeal Obamacare, and it can be, and, and it can be replaced with something much better for everybody. Let it be for everybody. But much better and much less expensive for people and for the government. And we can do it. So I've watched the politicians. I've dealt with them all my life. If you can't make a good deal with a politician, then there's something wrong with you. You're certainly not very good. And that's what we have representing us. They will never make America great again. They don't even have a chance. They're controlled fully, they're controlled fully by the lobbyists, by the donors, and by the special interests, fully. Yes, they control them. Hey, I have lobbyists. I have to tell you. I have lobbyists that can produce anything for me. They're great. But you know what? it won't happen. It won't happen. Because we have to stop doing things for some people, but for this country, it's destroying our country. We have to stop, and it has to stop now. Now, our country needs, our country needs a truly great leader, and we need a truly great leader now. We need a leader that wrote The Art of the Deal. We need a leader that can bring back our jobs, can bring back our manufacturing, can bring back our military, can take care of our vets. Our vets have been abandoned. And we also need a cheerleader. You know, when President Obama was elected, I said, Well, the one thing, I think he'll do well. I think he'll be a great cheerleader for the country. I think he'd be a great spirit. He was vibrant. He was young. I really thought that he would be a great cheerleader. He's not a leader. That's true. You're right about that. But he wasn't a cheerleader. He's actually a negative force. He's been a negative force. He wasn't a cheerleader; he was the opposite. We need somebody that can take the brand of the United States and make it great again. It's not great again. We need, we need somebody, we need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again. We can do that. And, I will tell you, I love my life. I have a wonderful family. They're saying, Dad, you're going to do something that's going to be so tough. You know, all of my life, I've heard that a truly successful person, a really, really successful person and even modestly successful cannot run for public office. Just can't happen. And yet that's the kind of mindset that you need to make this country great again. So ladies and gentlemen. I am officially running. for president of the United States, and we are going to make our country great again. It can happen. Our country has tremendous potential. We have tremendous people. We have people that aren't working. We have people that have no incentive to work. But they're going to have incentive to work, because the greatest social program is a job. And they'll be proud, and they'll love it, and they'll make much more than they would've ever made, and they'll be, they'll be doing so well, and we're going to be thriving as a country, thriving. It can happen. I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I tell you that. I'll bring back our jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from so many places. I'll bring back our jobs, and I'll bring back our money. Right now, think of this: We owe China $1.3 trillion. We owe Japan more than that. So they come in, they take our jobs, they take our money, and then they loan us back the money, and we pay them in interest, and then the dollar goes up so their deal's even better. How stupid are our leaders? How stupid are these politicians to allow this to happen? How stupid are they? I'm going to tell you, thank you. I'm going to tell you a couple of stories about trade, because I'm totally against the trade bill for a number of reasons. Number one, the people negotiating don't have a clue. Our president doesn't have a clue. He's a bad negotiator. He's the one that did Bergdahl. We get Bergdahl, they get five killer terrorists that everybody wanted over there. We get Bergdahl. We get a traitor. We get a no good traitor, and they get the five people that they wanted for years, and those people are now back on the battlefield trying to kill us. That's the negotiator we have. Take a look at the deal he's making with Iran. He makes that deal, Israel maybe won't exist very long. It's a disaster, and we have to protect Israel. But. So we need people, I'm a free trader. But the problem with free trade is you need really talented people to negotiate for you. If you don't have talented people, if you don't have great leadership, if you don't have people that know business, not just a political hack that got the job because he made a contribution to a campaign, which is the way all jobs, just about, are gotten, free trade terrible. Free trade can be wonderful if you have smart people, but we have people that are stupid. We have people that aren't smart. And we have people that are controlled by special interests. And it's just not going to work. So, here's a couple of stories happened recently. A friend of mine is a great manufacturer. And, you know, China comes over and they dump all their stuff, and I buy it. I buy it, because, frankly, I have an obligation to buy it, because they devalue their currency so brilliantly, they just did it recently, and nobody thought they could do it again. But with all our problems with Russia, with all our problems with everything, everything, they got away with it again. And it's impossible for our people here to compete. So I want to tell you this story. A friend of mine who's a great manufacturer, calls me up a few weeks ago. He's very upset. I said, What's your problem? He said, You know, I make great product. And I said, I know. I know that because I buy the product. He said, I can't get it into China. They won't accept it. I sent a boat over and they actually sent it back. They talked about environmental, they talked about all sorts of crap that had nothing to do with it. I said, Oh, wait a minute, that's terrible. Does anyone know this? He said, Yeah, they do it all the time with other people. I said, They send it back? Yeah. So I finally got it over there and they charged me a big tariff. They're not supposed to be doing that. I told them. Now, they do charge you tariff on trucks, when we send trucks and other things over there. Ask Boeing. They wanted Boeing's secrets. They wanted their patents and all their secrets before they agreed to buy planes from Boeing. Hey, I'm not saying they're stupid. I like China. I sell apartments for, I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China. Am I supposed to dislike them? I own a big chunk of the Bank of America Building at 1290 Avenue of the Americas, that I got from China in a war. Very valuable. I love China. The biggest bank in the world is from China. You know where their United States headquarters is located? In this building, in Trump Tower. I love China. People say, Oh, you don't like China? No, I love them. But their leaders are much smarter than our leaders, and we can't sustain ourself with that. There's too much, it's like, it's like take the New England Patriots and Tom Brady and have them play your high school football team. That's the difference between China's leaders and our leaders. They are ripping us. We are rebuilding China. We're rebuilding many countries. China, you go there now, roads, bridges, schools, you never saw anything like it. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge look like small potatoes. And they're all over the place. We have all the cards, but we don't know how to use them. We don't even know that we have the cards, because our leaders don't understand the game. We could turn off that spigot by charging them tax until they behave properly. Now they're going militarily. They're building a military island in the middle of the South China sea. A military island. Now, our country could never do that because we'd have to get environmental clearance, and the environmentalist wouldn't let our country, we would never build in an ocean. They built it in about one year, this massive military port. They're building up their military to a point that is very scary. You have a problem with ISIS. You have a bigger problem with China. And, in my opinion, the new China, believe it or not, in terms of trade, is Mexico. So this man tells me about the manufacturing. I say, That's a terrible story. I hate to hear it. But I have another one, Ford. So Mexico takes a company, a car company that was going to build in Tennessee, rips it out. Everybody thought the deal was dead. Reported it in the Wall Street Journal recently. Everybody thought it was a done deal. It's going in and that's going to be it, going into Tennessee. Great state, great people. All of a sudden, at the last moment, this big car manufacturer, foreign, announces they're not going to Tennessee. They're gonna spend their $1 billion in Mexico instead. Not good. Now, Ford announces a few weeks ago that Ford is going to build a $2.5 billion car and truck and parts manufacturing plant in Mexico. $2.5 billion, it's going to be one of the largest in the world. Ford. Good company. So I announced that I'm running for president. I would.. one of the early things I would do, probably before I even got in, and I wouldn't even use, you know, I have, I know the smartest negotiators in the world. I know the good ones. I know the bad ones. I know the overrated ones. You get a lot of them that are overrated. They're not good. They think they are. They get good stories, because the newspapers get buffaloed. But they're not good. But I know the negotiators in the world, and I put them one for each country. Believe me, folks. We will do very, very well, very, very well. But I wouldn't even waste my time with this one. I would call up the head of Ford, who I know. If I was president, I'd say, Congratulations. I understand that you're building a nice $2.5 billion car factory in Mexico and that you're going to take your cars and sell them to the United States zero tax, just flow them across the border. And you say to yourself, How does that help us, right? How does that help us? Where is that good? It's not. So I would say, Congratulations. That's the good news. Let me give you the bad news. Every car and every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we're going to charge you a 35 percent tax, and that tax is going to be paid simultaneously with the transaction, and that's it. Now, here's what is going to happen. If it's not me in the position, it's one of these politicians that we're running against, you know, the 400 people that we're. And here's what's going to happen. They're not so stupid. They know it's not a good thing, and they may even be upset by it. But then they're going to get a call from the donors or probably from the lobbyist for Ford and say, You can't do that to Ford, because Ford takes care of me and I take care of you, and you can't do that to Ford. And guess what? No problem. They're going to build in Mexico. They're going to take away thousands of jobs. It's very bad for us. So under President Trump, here's what would happen: The head of Ford will call me back, I would say within an hour after I told them the bad news. But it could be he'd want to be cool, and he'll wait until the next day. You know, they want to be a little cool. And he'll say, Please, please, please. He'll beg for a little while, and I'll say, No interest. Then he'll call all sorts of political people, and I'll say, Sorry, fellas. No interest, because I don't need anybody's money. It's nice. I don't need anybody's money. I'm using my own money. I'm not using the lobbyists. I'm not using donors. I don't care. I'm really rich. I. And by the way, I'm not even saying that's the kind of mindset, that's the kind of thinking you need for this country. So, because we got to make the country rich. It sounds crass. Somebody said, Oh, that's crass. It's not crass. We got $18 trillion in debt. We got nothing but problems. We got a military that needs equipment all over the place. We got nuclear weapons that are obsolete. We've got nothing. We've got Social Security that's going to be destroyed if somebody like me doesn't bring money into the country. All these other people want to cut the hell out of it. I'm not going to cut it at all; I'm going to bring money in, and we're going to save it. But here's what's going to happen: After I'm called by 30 friends of mine who contributed to different campaigns, after I'm called by all of the special interests and by the, the donors and by the lobbyists, and they have zero chance at convincing me, zero, I'll get a call the next day from the head of Ford. He'll say. Please reconsider, I'll say no. He'll say, Mr. President, we've decided to move the plant back to the United States, and we're not going to build it in Mexico. That's it. They have no choice. They have no choice. There are hundreds of things like that. I'll give you another example. Saudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day. $1 billion a day. I love the Saudis. Many are in this building. They make a billion dollars a day. Whenever they have problems, we send over the ships. We say we're gonna protect. What are we doing? They've got nothing but money. If the right person asked them, they'd pay a fortune. They wouldn't be there except for us. And believe me, you look at the border with Yemen. You remember Obama a year ago, Yemen was a great victory. Two weeks later, the place was blown up. Everybody got out, and they kept our equipment. They always keep our equipment. We ought to send used equipment, right? They always keep our equipment. We ought to send some real junk, because, frankly, it would be, we ought to send our surplus. We're always losing this gorgeous brand new stuff. But look at that border with Saudi Arabia. Do you really think that these people are interested in Yemen? Saudi Arabia without us is gone. They're gone. And I'm the one that made all of the right predictions about Iraq. You know, all of these politicians that I'm running against now, it's so nice to say I'm running as opposed to if I run, if I run. I'm running. But all of these politicians that I'm running against now, they're trying to disassociate. I mean, you looked at Bush, it took him five days to answer the question on Iraq. He couldn't answer the question. He didn't know. I said, Is he intelligent? Then I looked at Rubio. He was unable to answer the question, is Iraq a good thing or bad thing? He didn't know. He couldn't answer the question. How are these people gonna lead us? How are we gonna, how are we gonna go back and make it great again? We can't. They don't have a clue. They can't lead us. They can't. They can't even answer simple questions. It was terrible. But Saudi Arabia is in big, big trouble. Now, thanks to fracking and other things, the oil is all over the place. And I used to say it, there are ships at sea, and this was during the worst crisis, that were loaded up with oil, and the cartel kept the price up, because, again, they were smarter than our leaders. They were smarter than our leaders. There is so much wealth out there that can make our country so rich again, and therefore make it great again. Because we need money. We're dying. We're dying. We need money. We have to do it. And we need the right people. So Ford will come back. They'll all come back. And I will say this, this is going to be an election, in my opinion, that's based on competence. Somebody said, thank you, darlin'. Somebody said to me the other day, a reporter, a very nice reporter, But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. That's true. But actually I am. I think I am a nice person. People that know me, like me. Does my family like me? I think so, right. Look at my family. I'm proud of my family. By the way, speaking of my family, Melania, Barron, Kai, Donnie, Don, Vanessa, Tiffany, Evanka did a great job. Did she do a great job? Great. Jared, Laura and Eric, I'm very proud of my family. They're a great family. So the reporter said to me the other day, But, Mr. Trump, you're not a nice person. How can you get people to vote for you? I said, I don't know. I said, I think that number one, I am a nice person. I give a lot of money away to charities and other things. I think I'm actually a very nice person. But, I said, This is going to be an election that's based on competence, because people are tired of these nice people. And they're tired of being ripped off by everybody in the world. And they're tired of spending more money on education than any nation in the world per capita, than any nation in the world, and we are 26th in the world, 25 countries are better than us in education. And some of them are like third world countries. But we're becoming a third word country, because of our infrastructure, our airports, our roads, everything. So one of the things I did, and I said, you know what I'll do. I'll do it. Because a lot of people said, He'll never run. Number one, he won't want to give up his lifestyle. They're right about that, but I'm doing it. Number two, I'm a private company, so nobody knows what I'm worth. And the one thing is that when you run, you have to announce and certify to all sorts of governmental authorities your net worth. So I said, That's OK. I'm proud of my net worth. I've done an amazing job. I started off, thank you, I started off in a small office with my father in Brooklyn and Queens, and my father said, and I love my father. I learned so much. He was a great negotiator. I learned so much just sitting at his feet playing with blocks listening to him negotiate with subcontractors. But I learned a lot. But he used to say, Donald, don't go into Manhattan. That's the big leagues. We don't know anything about that. Don't do it. I said, I gotta go into Manhattan. I gotta build those big buildings. I gotta do it, Dad. I've gotta do it. And after four or five years in Brooklyn, I ventured into Manhattan and did a lot of great deals, the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I was responsible for the convention center on the west side. I did a lot of great deals, and I did them early and young. And now I'm building all over the world, and I love what I'm doing. But they all said, a lot of the pundits on television, Well, Donald will never run, and one of the main reasons is he's private and he's probably not as successful as everybody thinks. So I said to myself, you know, nobody's ever going to know unless I run, because I'm really proud of my success. I really am. I've employed, I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. That means medical. That means education. That means everything. So a large accounting firm and my accountants have been working for months, because it's big and complex, and they've put together a statement, a financial statement, just a summary. But everything will be filed eventually with the government, and we don't use extensions or anything. We'll be filing it right on time. We don't need anything. And it was even reported incorrectly yesterday, because they said, He had assets of $9 billion. So I said, No, that's the wrong number. That's the wrong number. Not assets. So they put together this. And before I say it, I have to say this. I made it the old fashioned way. It's real estate. You know, it's real estate. It's labor, and it's unions good and some bad and lots of people that aren't in unions, and it's all over the place and building all over the world. And I have assets, big accounting firm, one of the most highly respected, 9 billion 240 million dollars. And I have liabilities of about $500 million. That's long term debt, very low interest rates. In fact, one of the big banks came to me and said, Donald, you don't have enough borrowings. Could we loan you $4 billion? I said, I don't need it. I don't want it. And I've been there. I don't want it. But in two seconds, they give me whatever I wanted. So I have a total net worth, and now with the increase, it'll be well over $10 billion. But here, a total net worth of net worth, not assets, not, a net worth, after all debt, after all expenses, the greatest assets, Trump Tower, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Bank of America building in San Francisco, 40 Wall Street, sometimes referred to as the Trump building right opposite the New York, many other places all over the world. So the total is $873754000. Now I'm not doing that. I'm not doing that to brag, because you know what? I don't have to brag. I don't have to, believe it or not. I'm doing that to say that that's the kind of thinking our country needs. We need that thinking. We have the opposite thinking. We have losers. We have losers. We have people that don't have it. We have people that are morally corrupt. We have people that are selling this country down the drain. So I put together this statement, and the only reason I'm telling you about it today is because we really do have to get going, because if we have another three or four years, you know, we're at $8 trillion now. We're soon going to be at $20 trillion. According to the economists, who I'm not big believers in, but, nevertheless, this is what they're saying, that $24 trillion, we're very close, that's the point of no return. $24 trillion. We will be there soon. That's when we become Greece. That's when we become a country that's unsalvageable. And we're gonna be there very soon. We're gonna be there very soon. So, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly. I would repeal and replace the big lie, Obamacare. I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words. Nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump. Nobody. I will find, within our military, I will find the General Patton or I will find General MacArthur, I will find the right guy. I will find the guy that's going to take that military and make it really work. Nobody, nobody will be pushing us around. I will stop Iran from getting nuclear weapons. And we won't be using a man like Secretary Kerry that has absolutely no concept of negotiation, who's making a horrible and laughable deal, who's just being tapped along as they make weapons right now, and then goes into a bicycle race at 72 years old, and falls and breaks his leg. I won't be doing that. And I promise I will never be in a bicycle race. That I can tell you. I will immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration, immediately. Fully support and back up the Second Amendment. Now, it's very interesting. Today I heard it. Through stupidity, in a very, very hard core prison, interestingly named Clinton, two vicious murderers, two vicious people escaped, and nobody knows where they are. And a woman was on television this morning, and she said, You know, Mr. Trump, and she was telling other people, and I actually called her, and she said, You know, Mr. Trump, I always was against guns. I didn't want guns. And now since this happened, it's up in the prison area, my husband and I are finally in agreement, because he wanted the guns. We now have a gun on every table. We're ready to start shooting. I said, Very interesting. So protect the Second Amendment. End, end Common Core. Common Core should, it is a disaster. Bush is totally in favor of Common Core. I don't see how he can possibly get the nomination. He's weak on immigration. He's in favor of Common Core. How the hell can you vote for this guy? You just can't do it. We have to end education has to be local. Rebuild the country's infrastructure. Nobody can do that like me. Believe me. It will be done on time, on budget, way below cost, way below what anyone ever thought. I look at the roads being built all over the country, and I say I can build those things for one third. What they do is unbelievable, how bad. You know, we're building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the Old Post Office, we're converting it into one of the world's great hotels. It's gonna be the best hotel in Washington, DC We got it from the General Services Administration in Washington. The Obama administration. We got it. It was the most highly sought after, or one of them, but I think the most highly sought after project in the history of General Services. We got it. People were shocked, Trump got it. Well, I got it for two reasons. Number one, we're really good. Number two, we had a really good plan. And I'll add in the third, we had a great financial statement. Because the General Services, who are terrific people, by the way, and talented people, they wanted to do a great job. And they wanted to make sure it got built. So we have to rebuild our infrastructure, our bridges, our roadways, our airports. You come into La Guardia Airport, it's like we're in a third world country. You look at the patches and the 40 year old floor. They throw down asphalt, and they throw. You look at these airports, we are like a third world country. And I come in from China and I come in from Qatar and I come in from different places, and they have the most incredible airports in the world. You come to back to this country and you have LAX, disaster. You have all of these disastrous airports. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. Save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security without cuts. Have to do it. Get rid of the fraud. Get rid of the waste and abuse, but save it. People have been paying it for years. And now many of these candidates want to cut it. You save it by making the United States, by making us rich again, by taking back all of the money that's being lost. Renegotiate our foreign trade deals. Reduce our $18 trillion in debt, because, believe me, we're in a bubble. We have artificially low interest rates. We have a stock market that, frankly, has been good to me, but I still hate to see what's happening. We have a stock market that is so bloated. Be careful of a bubble because what you've seen in the past might be small potatoes compared to what happens. So be very, very careful. And strengthen our military and take care of our vets. So, so important. Sadly, the American dream is dead. But if I get elected president I will bring it back bigger and better and stronger than ever before, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. That's so nice. Isn't he a great guy. He doesn't get a fair press; he doesn't get it. It's just not fair. And I have to tell you I'm here, and very strongly here, because I have great respect for Steve King and have great respect likewise for Citizens United, David and everybody, and tremendous resect for the Tea Party. Also, also the people of Iowa. They have something in common. Hard working people. They want to work, they want to make the country great. I love the people of Iowa. So that's the way it is. Very simple. With that said, our country is really headed in the wrong direction with a president who is doing an absolutely terrible job. The world is collapsing around us, and many of the problems we've caused. Our president is either grossly incompetent, a word that more and more people are using, and I think I was the first to use it, or he has a completely different agenda than you want to know about, which could be possible. In any event, Washington is broken, and our country is in serious trouble and total disarray. Very simple. Politicians are all talk, no action. They are all talk and no action. And it's constant; it never ends. And I'm a conservative, actually very conservative, and I'm a Republican. And I'm very disappointed by our Republican politicians. Because they let the president get away with absolute murder. You see always, oh we're going to do this, we're going to,. Nothing ever happens; nothing ever happens. You look at Obamacare. A total catastrophe and by the way it really kicks in in '16 and it is going to be a disaster. People are closing up shops. Doctors are quitting the business. I have a friend of mine who's a doctor, a very good doctor, a very successful guy. He said, I have more accountants than I have patients. And he needs because it is so complicated and so terrible and he's never had that before and he's going to close up his business. And he was very successful guy. But it's happening more and more. Look at Obamacare with a $5 billion website. I have many websites, many, many websites. They're all over the place. But for $10, okay? Now everything about Obamacare was a lie. It was a filthy lie. And when you think about it, lies, I mean are they prosecuted? Does anyone do anything? And what are the Republican politicians doing about it? He lied about the doctor, he lied about every aspect. You can keep your plan. And you've all heard that hundreds of times. That's like the real estate location, location. I don't even say it anymore because everybody goes location, location. But you have heard this about Obamacare. And it's disgraceful. It's a big, fat, horrible lie. Your deductibles are going through the roof. You're not going to get, unless you're hit by an army tank, you're not going to get coverage. And people that had plans that they loved, that they really loved, don't have those plans anymore. So it's a real, real disaster. And somebody has to repeal and replace Obamacare. And they have to do it fast and not just talk about it. Now, we have to build a fence. And it's got to be a beauty. Who can build better than Trump? I build; it's what I do. I build; I build nice fences, but I build great buildings. Fences are easy, believe me. I saw the other day on television people just walking across the border. They're walking. The military is standing there holding guns and people are just walking right in front, coming into our country. It is so terrible. It is so unfair. It is so incompetent. And we don't have the best coming in. We have people that are criminals, we have people that are crooks. You can certainly have terrorists. You can certainly have Islamic terrorists. You can have anything coming across the border. We don't do anything about it. So I would say that if I run and if I win, I would certainly start by building a very, very powerful border. Again, the politicians talk about it and they do nothing about it. Benghazi. Oh, Benghazi, Benghazi. Everything is Benghazi. What happens? Nothing. IRS, e mails. I get sued all the time, okay. I run a big business. You know I've always said it's very, very hard for a person who is very successful. I have done so many deals. Almost all of them have been tremendously successful. You'll see that when I file my statements. I mean you will see; you will be very proud of me, okay. But I've always said, and I said it strongly, it's very hard for somebody that does tremendous numbers of deals to run for politics, run for political office, any office, let alone president. Because you've done so much; you've beaten so many people; you've created so many, Look, Obama, what did he do? No deal. He never did a deal. He did one deal. A house. And if you did that house you'd be in jail right now, okay. He got away with murder. But I can tell you, e mails. IRS, the e mails, thousands of them, they were lost; they were lost. If you were in my world you would know that e mails can't be lost; they can't be lost. So why aren't our politicians finding out where those e mails are? They talk about executive orders and they talk about immigration and they talk about oh well we have to stop the border; that's the end of it. Believe me if I did something you would have a border that would be great. But they talk about it. And then you have a president that does an executive order. Nobody even heard of an executive order. He does it to let people come in and nobody does anything about executive orders. Why didn't they go to court and ask for declaratory judgment, which is something that when you know somebody is going to go after you and when it's in writing, and he's been saying it for a long time; he said, I'm going to approve this and that, why didn't our Republicans go in and get a declaratory judgment from the courts because you could have started the process six months earlier. Instead they have a weak lawsuit, that probably the time it's finished, I know so much about this, six, seven, eight years from now everyone's going to forget about it. We'll be into a different mode, and our country will be further destroyed. So we have to do something. Jobs. China. I mean I've made so much money fighting against the Chinese. One of the best deals I ever did was against the Chinese, and they respect me for it. And I know them. And they say, we can't believe what we're getting away with. We can't believe how stupid your leaders are. They tell me that. Now they don't know I'm going to go and make a speech about it, but why not. But they tell me that. And by the way, especially for the folks here that sell so much, goods, I mean the goods you sell are incredible; I don't know if you've been watching what's happening with the devaluations of so many countries. The Euro, China is going crazy with the devaluation. I never thought that they'd have the guts to do what they're doing. They are devaluing down to nothing. And what it's going to do is make it impossible for you to sell your product; it's going make it impossible for you to compete. And they're getting away with it. And they wouldn't have even done it two years ago, but now they feel we're so weak and we have so many different problems all over the world that they can do it. But you watch this devaluation of all of it. I mean the Euro, China, Mexico; everybody is devaluing. And when you hear the dollar is getting stronger, it sounds good. You know it's one of those things, sounds good. Be very careful. Be very careful. Because we're just going to lose more and more business to these foreign countries that really know what they are doing. They have it set. Don't forget another thing. China became the number one economic power a year ago. That was unthinkable; to think that that was going to happen. It was absolutely unthinkable. So it happened and it's very, very sad. Now we spent $2 trillion in Iraq. We got nothing. They don't even respect us; they don't even care about us. Until they started getting their ass kicked, and call, oh please come back and help us. We want you out; then all of the sudden a new group forms, ISIS. By the way, you know how they formed. They took the oil. And for those of you that know and love Donald Trump, there are some of you, have I been saying for four years, keep the oil. So now ISIS has the oil. And the stuff that ISIS doesn't have, Iran is going to take. So we get nothing. We have $2 trillion and we have thousands of lives lost, thousands, and we have, what do we have. I mean I walk down the streets of New York and I see so many wounded warriors, incredible people. And we have to help those people, we have to help our vets, we have to help our military, we have to build our military. But, and we have to do it fast; we have to do it fast. We have incompetent people. They put people in charge that have no clue what they're doing. It needs money. We have to make our country rich again so we do that, so we can save Social Security. 'Cause I'm not a cutter; I'll probably be the only Republican that does not want to cut Social Security. I'm not a cutter of Social Security; I want to make the country rich so that Social Security can be afforded, and Medicare and Medicaid. Get rid of the waste, get rid of the fraud, but you deserve your Social Security; you've been paying your Security. And like, I like Congressman Ryan, I like a lot of the people that are talking about you know cutting Social Security, and by the way the Democrats are eating your lunch on this issue. It's an issue that you're not going to win; you've got to make the country rich again and strong again so that you can afford it, and so you can afford military, and all of the other things. Now, we have a game changer now, and the game changer is nuclear weapons. We really do have to get strong, and we have to get strong fast. We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon. We can't do it. Can't do it. We cannot let that happen. You know in the old days, I would have said 100 years ago, 50 years ago, 30 years ago, pull out and let them fight each other. Here we are in Syria. We're fighting people that want to overturn Syria. Think of this. We're fighting ISIS, but ISIS wants to overturn the government. Maybe you let them fight for a little while and then you take out the one that remains, okay. But think of it; think of it. ISIS is fighting them and we are bombing the hell out of them, but we want Syria to fall. There are so many things; there are so many things. But the one game changer that we have to be careful with, that we never really had to think about too much before, other than a cetain number of years ago, is the nuclear. Nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles. You can take out the East Coast of this country, you can take out large sections of the Midwest, you can take out things that were unthinkable. The power. And we have to be in a position where that never, ever, ever, every happens. We've never had this before. We have a situation in Afghanistan; we're spending tremendous amounts of money there. We're trying to do the right thing. We have leadership, again, no leadership respects us. You know, leadership of other places never respect stupid people, okay, that's one thing you're going to find. The same thing is happening there. And I never knew that Afghanistan until a year ago or so, Afghanistan has tremendous wealth in minerals, different, not the oil, but minerals. And we're fighting here, and on the other side of the mountain China is taking out all the minerals. They're taking it out. Trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals. So we're fighting here and they are taking it out, looking at us and saying thank you very much sucker. It's really, really crazy. So we have to rebuild quickly our infrastructure of this country. If we don't, The other day in Ohio a bridge collapsed. Bridges are collapsing all over the country. The reports on bridges and the like are unbelievable, what's happening with our infrastructure. I go to Saudi Arabia, I go to Dubai; I am doing big jobs in Dubai. I go to various different places. I go to China. They are building a bridge on every corner. They have bridges that make the George Washington Bridge like small time stuff. They're building the most incredible things you have ever seen. They are building airports in Qatar, which they like to say cutter but I've always said Qatar so I'll keep it Qatar what the hell. But they're building, they're building an airport and have just completed an airport the likes of which you have never seen, in Dubai an airport the likes of which you have never seen. And then I come back to LaGuardia where the runways have potholes. The place is falling apart. You go into the main terminal and they have a terraza floor that's so old it's falling apart. And they have a hole in it, and they replace it with asphalt. So you have a white terraza floor and they put asphalt all over the place. This is inside, not outside. And I just left Dubai where they have the most incredible thing you've ever seen. In fact my pilot said oh Mr. Trump this is such an honor. I said it's not an honor; they're just smart. But you look at LAX, and you look at Kennedy Airport, and you look at our airports generally, you look at our roadways where they're crumbling. You look at all of the things that are bad, I'll give you an example. And this isn't part of what I was going to say, but I ride down the highways and somebody makes those guard rails. You know the guard rails. The ones that sort of go like this that are always bent, rusted and horrible. Did you ever see more than like 20 feet which isn't corroded, or bent or the heat, if it gets too hot, it just crushes. Now they've been selling this thing for 25 years. Why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works. Because they don't know; they don't know what's happening. Somebody made a lot of money on that. They don't know what is happening. So we have to make our country great again. We have to rebuild our country. And we have a long way to go. We are just in such serious trouble because we owe so much money. Now we owe it to the Chinese, a lot of it. We owe it to other countries. They're the ones that hold the debt. And then we give them money. We have countries that we owe money to and yet we're giving them subsidies. I just ordered thousands of television sets and between LG and Samsung and I mean you know, No American company comes to see and comes to bid. It's South Korea, and whenever they have a problem we send the battleships, we send the destroyers, we send our airplanes, we're going to protect them. What are we doing; why aren't they paying us? Why aren't they paying us; what are we doing? I order thousands and thousands of sets all the time, for some reason it's South Korea. You know whether it's China, South Korea, but in this case televisions, South Korea. Why aren't they doing something to justify what is going on? Now, we have a very important election coming up. We have a presidential election coming up. And we have some good people. Nobody like Trump of course, but these are minor details. We have some good people. It' can't be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed. He failed. I mean I liked him. Look, like him, dislike him, the 47 percent statement that he made, that's not going away. The Romneycare from Massachusetts, that's not going away. What do you think they're going to say oh we won't bring that up this time. It's not fair because it was a long t, That doesn't work. But more importantly, he choked. Something happened to him in the last month. He had that election won. And let me tell you something. That election, sort of like a dealmaker that can't close the deal. I know many of those guys; they get it up to the one yard line, they go ah, ah I can't close it. Or a golfer that can't sink the three footer to win the tournament. And there are many of them. Most people are like that; I mean most people are like that. You can't give somebody another chance, 'cause actually I think this election is tougher to win than beating a failed president. I really do. I think beating Obama would have been a much easier one than the one that's coming up, which is sad to say but true. So you can't have Romney. He choked. You can't have Bush. The last thing we need is another Bush. Now I made that statement very strongly, and now every one says the last thing, You know they copied it. I'll be accused of copying the statement; that's the bad thing. But I said it. I was the one that said it first, and I mean it. The last thing we need is another Bush. Now, he's totally in favor of Common Core; that's a disaster, that's bad, it should be local and all of that. But he's totally in favor of Common Core. He's very, very weak on immigration. Don't forget, remember his statement, they come for love. I say, what? Come for love? You've got these people coming, half of them are criminals. They're coming for love? They're coming for a lot of other reasons, and it's not love. And when he runs, you got to remember his brother really gave us Obama. I was never a big fan, but his brother gave us Obama. 'Cause Abraham Lincoln coming home back from the dead could not have won the election because it was going so badly and the economy was just absolutely in shambles that last couple of months. And then he appointed Justice Roberts. And Jeb wanted Justice Roberts. And Justice Roberts basically approved Obamacare in a shocking decision that nobody believes. So you can't have Jeb Bush. And he's going to lose aside from that; he's not going to win. So Mitt and, you just can't have those two. That's it. That's it. It's so simple. So just in summing up and I just wrote a few of these little points down because it's very important. And I watch these teleprompters, and by the way I think any president candidate that runs should not be allowed to use a teleprompter, because we got one that uses teleprompters. And people say, oh he is so quick on his feet. He is reading it. I mean give me a break. Everything is read. You don't really test the mettle of a man or a woman unless they can get up on stage and talk. And that's what we ended up getting, the king of teleprompters. But, so when I look at these things here I say you know what, it's so much easier, it would be so nice, just bah, pa, bah, pa, bah, bing, bing, bing. No problems, get off stage, everybody falls asleep and that's the end of that. But we have to do something about these teleprompters. But in looking at these situations, I built an incredible company. And you'll see that. An incredible company; a wonderful company. I employ thousands of people and I love doing what I'm doing. And in a certain way, I wish I weren't doing this, but our country is in such trouble and would be so easy to fix. We have such great potential. So if I run for president and if I win, I would totally succeed in: creating jobs; defeating ISIS and stopping the Islamic terrorists, and you have to do that; reducing the budget deficit, so important, have to do it; securing our Southern border, and I mean seriously securing it; stopping nuclear weapons in Iran and elsewhere; saving Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, without cutting it down to the bone because it's not fair to people that have been paying for their whole lives and other people and it's not fair to future people coming up, and we can do it; repealing Obamacare and replacing it with something far better for the people, and far less expensive, both for the people and for the country. And believe me there are plans that are so much better for everybody. And everybody can be covered. I'm not saying leave 50 percent of the people out. Everybody can be c, This plan is just a basic disaster. Nobody knows. As bad as the website was, this is how bad the plan itself is; fixing our country's infrastructure, our bridges, our schools, our highways, our airports. And that, I can tell you, nobody is close to Trump. I just got the best hotel in North America. I'm building, which is sort of interesting, think of this one. I'm building one of the great hotels of the world on Pennsylvania Avenue, right opposite the White House, between the White House and Congress. Right on Penn., The Old Post Office site, and I got it from Obama. Do you believe that? And everybody wanted it. So, I can't believe it myself. But it's going to be fantastic; and so many other things. I know what needs to be done to make America great again. We can make this country great again. The potential is enormous. And I am serious thinking of running for president because I can do the job. Thank you all very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. Beautiful. Thank you. We have so many problems in this country. We'll talk about a few of them. And we'll celebrate because ultimately, we're going to have victory. We're going to have victory. This is a movement that's happening. I had a lawyer come up to see me a little while ago that said Mr. Trump, I've been doing this for 35 years and never seen what happened here. I got a call from a writer from The New York Times. I have great respect for The New York Times. And called up, I know. I hear that. OK. It's a good story, not a bad story. And he said could I ask you a question? I said what? Very powerful writer, actually. He said how does it feel? How does what feel? He said what you've done has never ever been done before. You've dominated. You have taken over the polls. You know, on television, on FOX and CNN, they call it all Trump all the time. Can you believe it? All trump all the time. And by the way, their ratings are through the roof. If they weren't, they wouldn't put me on. I'll be honest. It's a simple formula in entertainment and television. If you get good ratings, if you get good ratings and these aren't good, these are monster, then you're going to be in all the time even if you have nothing to say. If you come up with a cure for a major, major, horrendous disease and if you don't get ratings, they don't bother even reporting it. It's very simple business. It's very simple. So we've gone on, we've had a lot of fun and now it's time to really start because this is going to happen, I'm telling you, I'm not going anymore. Somebody said today. We're not going anywhere. We are not going anywhere. Somebody said today you've done so well, you don't have to go any further. I said are you crazy? You know what? The writer the Times told me, he said it's been amazing what you've done. I said but I haven't won. We haven't won anything. What if I won? I'm having fun and all, but I haven't won. There's been no victory. He said it doesn't matter. What you've done is incredible. You have won. I said you're wrong, unless I win it's been a waste of time for me, I'll be honest. A total waste of time. I really mean that, too. We should have won, thank you, he said you will win. We should have won last time. Mitt Romney let us down. I mean, he let us down. He let us down. You know, one of the things that I'm really happy about, I'm surging, they said. Can you believe this one? I'm surging with women. Can you believe it? I have such respect for women. I cherish women. I'm going to take such good care of women's health care issues, you won't even believe it, but I'm surging with women. One of the things coming out, I'm watching television and they said Trump is surging with women. I said really? That's amazing. You know, it's incredible. I'll make like statements because, you know, Carly is giving me a little bit of a hard time even though her poll numbers are horrible. She's the one. She was another one. She is surging. Ben is, everybody is surging but me. Hilary is not surging, I tell you that. They are not saying, thank you. Hilary is not surging. Look, I like Carly and I like Ben and I like many of the people that I'm running against. I mean, many of these people are terrific people, but nobody is going to be able to do the job that I'm going to do. Nobody. They won't. They won't. Don't forget, I love these people in back of me. But they won't. I mean, what I do is I do deals. I deal. I have tremendous energy, tremendous to a point where it's almost ridiculous when you think about it. But we need somebody with great energy, with great passion, with great deal making skills. And we need a closer. We need closers. We don't have closers. We just don't have closers. And honestly, they are not deal people. I'll tell you they are good at raising money for their packs or whatever they holding. Probably, they are not supposed to do that but most of them are doing anyway. It's illegal as hell, but I think they are doing it anyway. You notice they have money in the pack but they don't have hard money, but the pack has given them, I say what is going on over here? How come I can't talk to anybody? And again, I have to tell you this, and I want to have your opinion. So I'm self funding I told you. But if I took hundreds of millions, I tell you what, I could have $200 million so fast. If I took that, would you people object if I promise not to do anything from the people I took it from? No? I had a group in Iowa, actually, they were much more vocal about this one issue. And they stood up, no, no, the place, I mean, I realize how important it is, putting your own money in because I'm telling people that Jeb, nice guy, really a nice guy. Jeb is more popular than one person I know. But all of them. I don't want to go through the names. They have money put up in packs or hard money, wherever the money is, believe me, I was the king. I was the king. You know, I was the white haired, no, blonde haired, let's say blonde. But, I was the blonde head. I was perfect. I was the ultimate. I was the ultimate sort of insider. I put up money. They loved me. But then when I said I'm running, they all looked at me like the RNC, Reince is a great guy but it took him a little while because they looked at me like you're not supposed to be doing that. You're supposed to be putting up money. And if you need something in two years, three years, five years, they will do whatever you want. And what happened is I know the system I think better than anybody. I know the tax system. Look, taxes. Who knows better than me? We're going to reduce taxes. We're going to make the hedge fund, any hedge fund guys it would be mostly, you got good seats. Are there any hedge fund guys in this room? If there are, you should probably leave right now. But I have a friend in the hedge fund business, not really a friend. Not actually a nice guy, but it be goof representing us, I will tell you. Because by the time I finish he might not have much of a hedge fund. But I said what did you make last year? He said about $250 million. This is serious. I said, oh, that's a lot of money. What did you pay in taxes? He goes, Don, practically nothing. That was a couple years ago. I never forgot it. The other day he calls me up because he heard me talk about hedge fund guys are going to pay up. And he call up the other day. I was only kidding, you know, when I said that or sort of it. He doesn't know what to do. The truth is they will do just fine. They will do just fine because we'll make the country so successful, they will end up doing better. They will end up doing better. They will end up doing better. But we got to lower taxes for a lot of people. Corporations paying far too much, far too much, middle income people are being decimated, they are being decimated. I mean, we have a group of 200 guys but the middle income in this country is being decimated and we're going to change it. We're going to change it. So I'll be announcing over the next three or so weeks, I'll be announcing, I think a great tax plan. I know the tax code. I know everything about it, probably as well as anybody, there is, right? And we are going to be doing something that's going to be really pro, growth, really reduction in taxes. We're going to get the $2.5 trillion that's in other countries, we're going to get it back. No, we're going to get it back. And you know, you have corporate inversion. Does anybody know what that means? You know, in the old days people might leave New York for Texas or they may go from New Jersey to Florida or whatever. It's not that way anymore. Now they go from this country to other countries, and they go for two reasons, lower taxes, lower labor, but lower taxes. You have countries that want to charge them nothing. So they take these companies and these guys, they make a fortune, they have no real loyalty in many cases. They have no real loyalty to the United States. They want to show good profit and loss. So they take and go to another country. And all of a sudden their numbers look good. And they can't bring their money back in. And by the way for two and a half, three years, I have seen every politician agrees we should lower the tax on bringing money because it's so onerous that nobody in this room would bring that money back. Everybody says it for two and a half years, Democrats, Republicans, liberals, conservatives, everybody, they can't make a deal. They can't make a deal. We have a government that's really messed up because we don't have a leader at the top. A right leader could get it done. The right leader will get it done and you will see numbers like you've never seen before. I actually believe that and we're in trouble. You know, I've made the statement and I've said this before, the American dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. I made that statement. And I'll tell you what happens and it happens a lot. The other day I went home and I said to my wife, what's wrong? Oh, darling, you were very tough. What? What did I do? Of course, it's live television. She said you said the American dream is dead. I said no, I said the American dream is dead but I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. She said no, you didn't. You just said it's dead. So I turn on television, it's wonderful to record this and see it ten hours later. I turn on television and me standing in this big crowd, the American dream is dead. I said, oh. Again, the dishonest media. I went ballistic. I was so angry. But the American dream is going to be better. I tell you what? We can make it better than ever before. We can do, I mean, we're in Texas. We can do things with oil and gas that will be unbelievable. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Try sending your oil outside of the boundaries of the United States. How ridiculous. And we're sitting on top because of technology, we can be the number one energy producer in the world right here in the United States. But we have our laws, we have everything is wrong. And I have so many friends in the energy business, they are great people, they are working, they are not as rich as they were about two months ago, but these are minor details. They will be fine. But we can do things with energy that will be so, so incredible, which is great for Texas but great for the country. It's great for the country. Now, China, Japan, true, you can't be upset with China or Japan or Mexico. Can't be upset with anyone. You know, when I announced for the presidency, it was very interesting what happened. I made a beautiful speech. I thought it was wonderful. Everything was fine. A week and a half later, they attacked me. In other words they went to. And then they lied. They made it up. I'm talking about illegal immigration. And I brought up a subject called illegal immigration. And I just saw back stage some of the families who were decimated. Their families were decimated, their sons, their daughters killed by illegal immigrants and it's a massive problem. We have to stop illegal immigration. We have to do it. We have to do it. Have to do it. And when I hear some of the people that I'm running against, including the Democrats, we have to build a wall, folks. We have to build a wall. And a wall works. All you have to do is go to Israel and say how is your wall working? Walls work. And I want people to come into the country but I want them to be legal and go through the process. I want them to come in. I want to have a big beautiful door but they have to be legal. They have to be. And if they are not going to be, they can't come in. And I'll tell you what, the first thing we do, you know, people realize, you look at crime in Chicago, you look at crime in so many different places and you see gangs. Many of these gang members are illegal immigrants. They are rough dudes. They will be out of here so freaking fast, And I think a lot of these countries send them in here because they don't want them. What do they want them in prison for 40 years? Look, look, whether it's any country, their leaders are smarter than our leaders. They are more cunning. They are tougher. They are better. And we take them, Kate in San Francisco, this magnificent young woman shot in the back by a guy sent over here probably pushed over, who knows, but he was an illegal immigrant came over, went to San Francisco. We have to end this sanction wary cities crap fast, fast. So he admits he's guilty. Now he's got a lawyer. Oh, he didn't really know. He wasn't aiming there. It was a ricochet, blah, blah, blah. It's disgusting what's happening to our country. We are a dumping ground for the rest of the world. We are a dumping ground. And let me tell you something, the whole subject of anchor babies, did you hear that character from one of the networks? Anchor babies, just really not a nice term. I said what would you do, what would you say? And it gives me like a 12 word definition. I said no, we'll have to use anchor baby. But I don't mean to be disrespectful, but when a man has a problem and he's got his wife or his girlfriend and they move her over to the border for one day, has the baby on the other side of the border, our side, now that baby is a citizen of our country for however long the baby lives, hopefully a long, it's wrong. It's wrong. And by the way, by the way, the law doesn't call that. That's not what the law says and people are finding out now that I'm right. We didn't say that somebody can be pregnant for nine months, come across the border, have a baby and now it's ours and we have to take care of the baby forever. It doesn't say that. It does not say it. So we have to straighten out, we have to straighten out our act. We're going to have a great country. We're going to have a great border. We're going to have a border that's a real border. You people are suffering. I'm in New York but from New York, too. They are all over the place. We want people to be in our country legally. Legally. And we want great people, too. We want people of achievement. If you go to Harvard or Stanford or the Wharton school of finance or any of these schools or Yale and you're the top in your close, you graduate and want to stay in the United States and have your career here, you can't. They throw you out. They put you back in China, they send you back to Mexico. They said those are the people, we need those people. We need them in Silicon Valley. We need in Manhattan. We need them in Dallas. We need them. Why are we throwing them out? They want to be in this country and we throw them out. So we have so many things we can do. So many things we can do. Now I'll give you the little thing that happened the other day. Made a speech on behalf of the tea party. And by the way, the tea party people are fantastic people. They are fantastic people. They love the country so much and you talk about people that get decimated, they just get decimated by the media. These are fantastic people. They love this country. These are the people that we want. But I look at what's going on and I look at what's happening and I made a speech in Washington the other day for the tea party and your senator, too, Senator Cruz who happens to be a good guy. Good guy. Now if he comes out and attacks me on Wednesday night, I will take it back immediately. OK? But he is a good guy. So I'm standing there and the capital building has a massive scaffolding around it, right? Have you seen it? Massive. I said man that's a big deal. As a real estate guy, the thing I do best is build. Hey, wouldn't it be good to have the president that knows how to build? Like I'm so good at it. Infrastructures, roads, airports, highways, I could do it for a fraction. You know, I'm building the old post office on Pennsylvania Avenue under budget ahead schedule, can you believe that? And I got it from the Obama administration and everyone else wanted it, which I still haven't figured out but it's going to be a great hotel. But they are doing the capital building and it has got massive, massive scaffolding. And we are having in 2016, you know, we're going to have a thing called like an election and they say that this massive scaffolding. I heard this the other day from a construction firm that this massive scaffolding, they want to have it for the inauguration, wouldn't that be nice for me? But they want to have all the scaffolding down but they can't do the work because they don't have enough time. They have so much time. What are they doing, caulking, pointing, fixing, structure, what the hell are they doing? It is not a big deal. So they are going to take all of the scaffolding down, paying millions to do that, millions and then after the inauguration, they are going to put it back up again and pay millions of dollars. Do you believe that? Right? Now I say do it simpler, get them to work faster. Do you agree? I like the idea. No, no. I like the idea of the scaffolding being down when they are swearing me in, I do. I don't want to see all the scaffolding all over the place. I want to see that beautiful, I want to see it. I love it. Such a beautiful building. But you know what? I told them, I said why don't you just move faster? Work faster. Get it done. So you take it down and you don't have to put it up. They said we never thought of that. Believe it? But they are going to take it down. They are going to take it down. So they are going to take it down and put it back up. Can you believe this? So let me tell you. I'm going to save my first money for the United States. If I win, I will let the scaffolding stay up, OK? All right? I'll let it stay up. We'll save millions of dollars. So in the pictures, they will have some scaffolding. They can probably no a days do something with that. So in the pictures we'll have scaffolding. So not if I win, stand up, what did you say? Not if you win, when you win. So a story I tell is a friend of mine who is a big manufacturer, great guy. Can't do business with China. Can't get his stuff in there. He calls me, he's depressed. He says to me, Donald, I can't deal with China and he's a good guy, does great stuff, better than they do. I can't sell it. They don't take it. Finally take it and charge a massive tax. A massive tax. Another friend of mine recently, he bought an airplane, a rich guy. Bought like for these people here. They probably all have, but a really good plane. Our country is being drained. Our jobs are being stolen by all these countries, not just them all of them. What would president Trump do? President trump? Trump, trump, trump. What would president Trump do? So I'd call the head of Ford or whatever company. But I'd call the head of Ford. I'd say congratulations. I understand you're building a massive plant in Mexico and you're taking a lot of jobs away from us in Michigan and other places. I don't like that. I don't like it. I just don't like it. And he will say, well, Mr. President, it's wonderful, wonderful for the economy. It's great. It's wonderful. Whose economy? Not for our economy. We lose on everything. We lose on jobs. We lose on money. We lose on everything. So what I'd say is the following, I don't want you to do that. And if you do it, you're not going to have any cars coming across the border unless you pay 35 percent tax. That's it. No, that's it. And they are going to say, they are going to say to me, Mr. President, please, please, please. Now, I guarantee you, let's say I make this call at 9:00 in the morning. By 5:00 in the afternoon I think the deal is done, they move back to the United States. It may take a half a day longer. May be 12:00 the following day, but I guarantee you, so they will, what will happen is I'll be called by lobbyists but not giving me money. I won't take it. So I turned down $5 million last week, $5 million. So I said I can't take it. You know, I go like this. I just close my eyes. You know, it's really sort of not natural to me to turn down money. Does that make, but I turn it down because once I know the game. Once they give you, you sort of owe them, right? You know. How can you tell a guy, you know, you gave me $5 million and helped me get elected and I'm going to hurt you with client. So, what happens, I would say, is that I will get a call from the head of Ford, and he'll say Mr. Trump, you're doing the wrong thing. I'd say, no, no, that's fine. Just do it. Just do what I say. Do what I say. And I guarantee you after I tell all the lobbyists, special interest and people that donate to everybody else but me because I won't take their money, after I tell them all no within a short period of time they will call up and they'll say, Mr. President we decided to move our plant back to the United States, sir. This is going to happen. That's what is going to happen. So, just a couple of more points and you know, it's depressing, isn't it depressing? You know, we're together, we love each other, but it's like depressing if you think about it. Because it doesn't end. I could stand up here all night long, I could tell you stories, they are all depressing. But the good news is, they can all be remedied. Every one of them. They can be remedied. So, Iran deal, Iran deal. They did not read that great book, where is that book? The Art of the Deal. They did not read it. Secretary of State Kerry, he actually may go down as worst than , because he made this deal. He may be the worst. He may top her because this deal is the all time worst. We're giving them 1.5, think of this, we're actually giving them $150 billion. Now think of it. Think of it. We don't have the right to inspect. We have to wait 24 days but before the clock starts ticking, we have to go through this whole process. I mean they could build their nuclear whatever, distribute and then have plenty of time leftover to clean the place up. So, you have a 24 day period, not anytime, anywhere, which is what it should be. Think of another thing. They have one instance where in a very major area, they self inspect. Now, can you believe this? They do their own inspections. They do their own inspections. And another thing, look, having a good deal, we should have doubled the sanctions, let , wait for another month or two. They would have come and we would have a deal like you've ever seen. We have our chief negotiators, Secretary Kerry at 73 years old goes into a bicycle race. Think of it. He's wearing the whole gear of helmet, he's like , he thinks he's in a bicycle race. He's actually in a race. It wasn't just casual, I could understand that. This is a guy that's in a bicycle race. 73 years old, all the gear, falls, breaks his leg in the middle of our thing. Takes two weeks off, goes back with crutches. The people from Iran say, what a shmuck. Can you believe this? But this is who we negotiate with. Now, think of this, it's embarrassing. Isn't it like embarrassing? How do you , I swear to you if I'm elected as president, I will never go into a bicycle race, I swear. So, but you know, one of the things. But I know the toughest guys in the world. Toughest smartest , I know people that are great. I know people that are overrated, won't use them. I know people that you never heard of better than all of them. I know the toughest guys and the smartest guys in the world. Carl Icahn called me. Carl Icahn is a great guy, very successful. If I put Carl Icahn in charge of trade with China, believe me, believe me, we do great. And, you know, believe me, instead of the people that we have that are political hacks, you know who is negotiating for us? Political hacks, political hacks. I asked for some numbers today before I came here. I said what's the United States trade deficit with China, Japan, and Mexico? Now, listen to these numbers. With China last year, we had a trade deficit of $343 billion. $343 billion. That's gone on for many years. A business that's no good. What do you do, you close it up, you start all over? You forget it. $343 billion. With Japan we're doing much better. It's only $67 billion. I call it that we're losing. Okay? Trade deficit. $67 billion. They send us so much, we send them practically nothing. Now, here is the beauty, Mexico. So Mexico, again, I love the people of Mexico. I respect the leaders. But they are too sharp. They are too good. So everyone said they won't build a wall because I said I'm going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it, right? Right? And all of these weak politicians, they are weak people. They are weak, weak people. They won't pay for it. I watch it on television. The idiots like Karl Rove. He said Mexico is going to pay for the wall. George Will, Mexico won't pay. Okay, think of this. First of all, there is going to be a wall. This isn't one of those deals where they jump over it, they go to Home Depot, buy a ladder, jump over the wall. This is a Trump wall. This is a Trump wall. This is a real wall. You know, you know, the Great Wall of China is 13000 miles. It was built 2000 years ago. It was actually built over a long period of time, but it started 2000 , it's a long time. So 13000 miles. What we're talking about is 2000 miles, but less, maybe 1000 because you'll have a lot of territory where you don't need it. You have natural barricades, you have some walls that were built that are OK. Although, I'd like to be nice in uniform. You know, if I ever put my name on it, I want a gorgeous wall. You know. The Trump wall, that would be a beautiful wall. That's why I have to make it beautiful because some day when I'm gone, they are going to name that wall after Trump, I think. But I listened to these guys, and they say, how stupid , I listened to them today. Some politicians said Trump will never be able to afford the wall. We can't afford it. It's too expensive. It's peanuts. It's peanuts. It's nothing. And Mexico is going to pay. Now, here is the Mexico number, right? Let's say the wall cost $4 billion. You know, they say $10 billion. That means $4 billion if you know what you're doing and the $4 billion will be much bigger, much better, much stronger than the $10 billion. Believe me. Oh, do I know how to build? Greatest. One of the greats. So, let's say it costs $4 or $5 billion. Our trade deficit with Mexico is $53 billion. So four or five billion is peanuts. It's peanuts. Mexico is going to pay and they will be happy. They will be happy. Now, look, if you have some dumb politician negotiating, I agree they won't pay, but when you have Trump negotiating for you on your behalf, they will pay. 100 percent. 100 percent. They're with him all the time, the people that did it. They never said, 'Hey, boss, uh, we're closing up the George Washington Bridge. No, they never said that, they're talking about the weather? Right? So he knew about it, he knew about it. Totally knew about it. He's got a very friendly group of people over there.. Look, it's called life, you gotta be smart in life. I would say there's less than 1 percent chance. It could be, but I doubt it. He knew about it. They mentioned it. They didn't mention at one of their meetings? I think they had breakfast like every day or every other day. They didn't say, 'Chris, tonight we're closing up the George Washington Bridge because the mayor of a certain area is against you' Oh, OK, they didn't mention it. Nobody believes it. No. 2: Nine downgrades of the state. Nine downgrades, it's a disaster, their property over there. The taxes are through, I'll use an expression: coming out of my ears, OK? Tremendous taxes over there. You had nine downgrades. You had Christie, you know, so friendly with President Obama during the flood. I actually called. I said, 'Let me ask you, is he going to vote for Obama?' I thought he was going to vote for Obama. I don't know, I thought he possibly did. Romney? I was very disappointed. One of the reasons I was disappointed is he called Christie and they had dinner right after the election. If Christie did that to me, I would have never spoken to him again. I woulda never done it. And he knows it is wrong. He is going to say, no, no, no, we don't want that, Ford. We don't want you to go. We are going to charge you of tax because, you know, the way you do it, you charge a tax. And then he is going to be hit by his lobbyists. They give him millions. He has $135, $140 million. I don't want anything. I don't want money. I'm just taking little small contributions for people. The woman said $7.32. And I was so, with a beautiful letter. It's amazing. I like that because that's like an investment. That adds up to the fuel for the plane for a trip to Iowa, OK? It all does, but who cares? I don't want that because I don't want to be controlled. Last week, you heard me say this. I turned down $5 million by a big lobbyist. Not a bad person. You know, a tough guy. Not a bad person. But when he gives me $5, he's not doing that because he thinks I have beautiful hair. It's not that bad. And it is my hair. Is it my hair? It is. It is actually. People don't know that. I proved that, you know, in Alabama. It was really hot. It was rainy. I took off my hat and everybody said it is really his hair. It's weird. I don't have to do that tonight. Sort of nice. But you know, so we would go over and the lobbyists would say, no, no, we gave you millions of dollars, Mr. President. And you owe it to Ford. Let. You have the lobbyists. You have. And after about ten minutes he is going to say I can't really do that. They really helped me in my campaign. With me, they're going to call me because I know all these guys. But they never did anything because I don't want money. I turned the money down. I turned down so much money. I feel like such a stupid person. No, it's true. First time in my life I feel stupid. Guys are giving me, offering me millions. Don, I would like to give you million. Wait, I'm telling you, $5 million. I could have it right now and I turn them down. I go back and say, do you think I'm doing the right thing? How about , I will just take a vote. How about if I take all these money and promise, I swear to you, that I won't do anything for these people. What about that? No? That's what I thought. I feel so stupid. But you know what? That's the way it has to be. Because I think one of the things they like about me is they don't, nobody is going to buy me. Nobody is going to buy me. All right. So after about ten minutes, Bush goes out and he says, all right, you can build your plant. Build it. I'm sorry. Please, I dare me. I mean, it was so terrible that I even thought about doing that, you know, because you contributed money. OK. Me, different. I'll call him up and say I have to go. I don't want you in Mexico. I love Mexico. I love the Mexican people. I have thousands have Mexican people that have worked for me over the years and even to this day. I mean, I love the Hispanics. The spirit. I love them. They are incredible people. But we have leaders that can't compete with their leaders. Their leaders are too smart. So I would say to the head of Ford, sorry. You will pay tax. Every car and every truck and every part that comes across that southern border, you're going to pay a 35 percent tax. OK? That's what's going to happen. And this is too easy. I don't need any of the killers. I'm going to use them anyway. But this is too easy. This is like forget it. This is taking candy from that beautiful little baby, OK. So easy. So what happens is they're going to say, no, no, no, and they're going to have people call me. But these are people that I didn't take any money, I didn't take anything. I don't want their money. So they are going to have people call me. And I'm going to say get out of here. And if I know them, they'll be friends of mine, maybe. I'll say I'm not interested. And I would say, let's say this whole process starts at 12:00 noon. I would say by 4:00 in the afternoon, the head of Ford will call me and say Mr. President, we've decided to build in the United States. That will happen. OK? That will happen. If they're really tough, they'll wait until the next day. But I guarantee you by 5:00 the next day, they're back. And that's great. That's what we need. We need jobs. We can't keep giving out our jobs. You know, college debt. I go all over and I see the vets are mistreated in this country so badly. Believe me. You know, they did a poll. I'm like the most popular person with the vets. You know, I built the Vietnam memorial in downtown Manhattan, OK. And the vets like me a lot. And they did a poll and people were shocked. Why would you be shocked? Because I'm going to take care of the vets. The other one, college. College debt. It is out of control. And I go around and I see students. And by the way, you see what's happening with the college? I mean, you talk about like what they're doing. The prices of these colleges. The way they're rapidly raising. And students are borrowing money from different people but also from the government. It is the thing that the government makes money on, college students. No, it's true. They're making a lot of money on college debt. And the big thing we need is jobs. And students come up to me and they say, Mr. Trump, I'm borrowed and I can't even, I don't know how I'll ever pay it off. This is somebody that is a junior or a senior in college. And it is almost like they have no hope. To me, it is one of the saddest things I've seen in making the rounds. College students, college debt. And they say, and then I apply for jobs. One was telling me from a very good college. Actually a college in Iowa where I was, a great college. And they were saying, you know, I worked hard. I became a great student. I just became one of the top students in my college. And I can't get a job, he said. And a lot of them can't get jobs. So now they have the debt and they can't get jobs because China has our jobs and Japan has our jobs and so many other places have our jobs. We don't have jobs. So they get out and there is no place to go and they don't know what to do. We're going to solve the problem because we're going to bring back the jobs from China and we are going to bring back the jobs from Japan. And we're going to be fair. But if you look at the deficit, the trade deficit that we have with China, it is astronomical. People have said how are going to balance the budget? How about like making some good deals with China and Japan? Look at the trade deficits. I was in Los Angeles two weeks ago. I saw ships that were so big. I've never seen anything like it with cars from Japan. They're pouring off. We sell them, actually, you sell them some beef, right? This is one of the beneficiaries, beef. But honestly, if you ever look at the difference, the numbers here, it is so crazy. We send wheat. They send cars. That's all going to change. And we're going to have great relationships with these people. And you know, the amazing thing, every country in the world, thinks the United States is represent by stupid people, and they're right, of course. No, they're wrong. Very stupid people. And every country in the world, I mean, every country in the world, everybody makes money. And the funny things is we don't get along with anybody. Think of it. Here we have deals that are all bad and everybody hates us. I just came in. And I'm watching on television. That we're really in a very bad place with Russia. Now, we're working on the Ukraine and I think that is fine, but why isn't Europe sort of like leading that whole charge? Why do we always leading? We're working on the Ukraine. I think that's terrible and all that stuff. We've got a lot of problems. We're sending an f,22, brand new, gorgeous. And we have fighters, our best military people are going over there. And we're worried about the Ukraine. I think Ukraine is great. I think we should worry about the Ukraine. But you know, Germany is over there. Germany is far richer than we are. Germany has made a fortune. We protect Germany for no money, OK. We protect South Korea for no money. So Germany is over there, right? And they're not worried about it. But Obama is talking about the Ukraine. Germany said let these dopey people take care of us. And all the European countries. So we are sending our fighters. Now in North Korea, you have a situation where, you know, he's raring his head again. I just were had 4000 sets for. And 4000, that's a lot of sets. They're all made in South Korea. They don't make them in Iowa. I wish. Does anyone make television sets? They don't make them in Iowa. They don't make them anywhere in this country. So I ordered 4000. Samsung, it is LG, it is all of them. Right? They're all from South Korea. Sony is from Japan. Their sets aren't as good anymore, but that's OK. But they're good sets. They are great. I paid a fortune. Enough saying, they make a fortune. Look at the deficit that we have that South Korea. I love South Korea. I love all these countries. But why is it that we protect them? So this guy raises his head. Nuclear this, I'm going to wipe them out. We immediately send, we have 28000 troops over there which is nothing compared to the million that they have in North Korea, a big army. OK. They don't pay us anything. What are we doing? And you know what? Somebody said that's not nice. You're asking them to pay. How can we police? We're watching the Ukraine, we are watching South Korea, we are watching Germany, we are watching Japan. We protect Japan. We have a treaty with Japan. If Japan gets attacked, we have to immediately go to their aid. OK? If we get attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us. That's a fair deal. No, no, that's the kind of deals we make. They have nothing. Don't worry about it. But if they get attacks, we have to go to Japan. Did you ever fly, that's a long flight. So we need smart people. And we can straighten this country out. We can make this country so, we can make it better than ever. We can make it better than ever. Saudi Arabia, I love Saudi Arabia. The people are very nice to me. They buy my apartments, you wouldn't believe it. It's true. They'll pay me anything. They have nothing but money. They have nothing but money. I have a beautiful plane. All of a sudden it doesn't look so good when I look at some of their planes. I'm jealous. It's terrible. I'm jealous. No, but Saudi Arabia, they make a billion dollars a day. In all fairness, that was before the, you know, oil went down. But now, let's say it is a half a billion. That's pretty good. You make a half billion a day. We protect them. We get nothing. And every time, if you think in Yemen those folks are after Yemen, then you ought to leave the room right now because you are not very smart. Yemen, did you ever see the border? It never ends. It is a straight line. It never ends. And you know what is on the other side, Saudi Arabia? The oil. If you think they are stopping at Yemen, they're looking for the oil. Don't forget I'm the one, the most militaristic person. I would build a military so strong, so powerful, so incredible, nobody would ever use it. Nobody would ever, we would never have to use it. I would have the best everything. You know, we have a military where we give to the allies, our allies. We give it to the wrong allies, by the way. You know that. We give it to the wrong allies. We don't give to the Kurds. We give to people. One bullet shot in the air, 2300 humvees, the best in the world. So I heard they left. And one day they abandoned 2300. I said no, no, no, you mean 23. You mean three. You mean two. You can't leave 2300. They abandoned 2300 armor plated, the best in the world humvees, 2300. Because one shot was fired in the air. These are the people we're helping. These are the people we're helping. And now the enemy has the humvees armor plated. And we have the ones where the non armored plated and our wounded warriors who are the greatest people we have in this country. They are the greatest. The greatest. And our soldiers aren't protected. And the enemy is because they have these great vehicles that they took. And that's just the humvees. You can go on to everywhere. They have the best equipment. So we have to get smart. And we have to know what we're doing. And I would build, I'm telling you. I am so into it. But in 2000, and Ann Coulter knows this. In 2004, as much as I am into the military, which I love and respect. I'm a huge fan of General Patton. I'm a huge fan of General Douglas MacArthur. To this day, he has the highest marks, I'm a person I believe in like marks and students and education. I think it is great. General Douglas MacArthur to this day has the highest rates in the history of west point. That means something. Nice thing. And we have to do something and we have to do it fast. We have to get the generals that are great. There was a general, I won't use his name, but he's leaving. And they said to him the other day about ISIS on television, what do you think about ISIS? Can we beat them? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. It's going to be very hard to beat ISIS. And I said to myself can you imagine George Patton saying, oh, it would be hard? He would have them knocked out in three days and say where do I go from here? Where? Where? General Douglas MacArthur getting out with his corn cob pipe right out of the airplane looking out over the land that he just took. Can you imagine him? First of all they wouldn't go on television. They're too busy fighting. They want to win. They are too busy winning. We don't have winners anymore. We don't have winners in this country. But we're going to turn it around. We are going to have winners. Now, speaking of winners, this is so important. We all know about trade. We've covered it. It is horrendous. I'm going to get the greatest negotiations. We're going to make great trades. We're going to make a lot of money. We are going to be great. Everyone is going to love us, OK? We have, they're going to love us. So you know, funny before, in Business Week magazine, again, they had a story a while ago. The ten things the Chinese most want. Now, who is tougher, the Chinese on me? I love them and I respect them. I just hate what they do to. But who is tougher than me? The ten things, one of the ten things was anything Trump. Apartments, anything. Anything Trump. I say how could that be possible? Because maybe they respect me or maybe they respect us. I don't know. But anything Trump. OK. So we're going to be respected. We are going to be really respected. We shouldn't to go to Iraq. We did. We made a mistake. But we went out. We should have kept the oil. And you would have ISIS believe. You wouldn't have. Now, people say that's such a harsh statement. She said take oil? Who the hell has the oil? The Iraqi government is totally corrupt. ISIS is, just formed out of Iraq. So we shouldn't have gone in. And then the way Obama got out was a total catastrophe. And then I say total catastrophe. And I said, Reuters, 2004, July. I said don't go in because if you do that in Iraq, and I'm one that likes to be, like I love the strength of military. You have to use it in the right location. If you do that, you're going to allow Iran to take over because you are going to decapitate. They would two powers that were equal. They fight. They would go ten feet, ten feet, ten feet, then they rest. This goes on for decades. They go ten, ten, right? Am I right? So we decapitate one of them. Now, Iran is as we speak, meeting with Iraq to take over the country. And you know who is getting the oil, most of the oil? The stuff that ISIS doesn't have? China. Do you know that China is getting so much oil? Do you know what we get? Nothing. Thousands of lives. Wounded warriors who I love all over. $2 trillion, we have nothing. In Afghanistan, which a lot of people don't know not, it is very rich in minerals. We're fighting in Afghanistan and they have very amazing mountains and ridges. We are fighting in Afghanistan over the years. And on the other side of the mountain, they have massive excavation equipment from China. They're taking out all the minerals as we fight. We need people that are smart. We have people that don't get it. Look at the deal we have with Iran. Look at this deal. It is going to, in my opinion, lead to an arm race the likes of which there has never been. Countries are going to line up for nukes. You are going to have perhaps nuclear proliferation. You are going to see things that you have never seen take place in a short period of time. This is the deal that just the other day, it was determines after months. Did you ever see a deal take so long? The deal has been going on forever. They had our prisoners. We never asked for our prisoners. How about that? Having a deal is good. But we should have doubled and tripled up the sanctions and negotiate from strengths. We could have done it so easily. Instead we have Kerry that goes on bicycle races. He's 73 years old. 73 years old! And I said it the last time I spoke. I swear I will never enter a bicycle race if I'm president. I swear. I swear! He's in a bicycle race. He falls. He breaks his leg. This is our chief negotiator. He is walking in. They're looking at him like what smock this is. I watched actually on Charlie Rose. I watched the chief negotiator being interviewed by Charlie. And after five minutes, I tweeted @realDonaldTrump. I tweeted. I said this guy is too smart for Kerry. I was right. So we didn't get the prisoners. And you know what the excuse was? We didn't ask for them. We didn't want to make the deal too complicated. Think of it. They're fighting us in Yemen. We didn't ask anything about Yemen. Like don't fight us. We have a 24 day wait period. So if we think they're doing nuclear, we have to wait 24 days. But see, that's not the worst part. The worst part is the clock start ticking. It could be months. We have to notify. There is whole process. I mean, they could build, shoot and build a couple more shoot. And by that time we still wouldn't be in there checking. Like I can just see them sweeping the floor and painting it battle shipment gray. You know, when I was with my father in Brooklyn, I used paint the Roger's battleship gray. I would always like. You know what I mean by battleship gray? Shiny battleship gray. I can see them doing it. So what we're doing is crazy. So you have that. And then beauty of all and you heard it two days ago. After years, we just found out that they're going to do in the most important section, they're going to do their own inspections. Did you hear this? Iran. They are going to do their own inspections. Did you hear about this? With some of these guys didn't hear? Where the hell have you been for the last three days? Look at these guys. They're smart guys. Three days ago I heard it. Nobody knew. They are going to self inspect. It is so unbelievable that you just can't even talk about it. And here is another part. We're going to give them $150 billion plus. And even if the deal isn't approved, they get that. In other words, they get that regardless. You know, when I do a deal, when I buy something, I pay them when I guy product, right? Whatever it is. I buy a building. I buy a business. I pay them. I put up a deposit and, right? But I pay them when the deal closes. We're paying them even if the deal doesn't happen. I've never heard of this before. I don't know who came one this idea. It must have been Kerry. No, it must have been. Because I don't think the Iranians. You know, the Iranians, Persians are great negotiators. They are natural great negotiators. I don't believe they would have thought of this because it is so crazy. No, it's true. They wouldn't have actually said, let's do this because it is so far out. Who would have ever think of it? They get $150 billion plus, plus, even if the deal is voted down and the deal doesn't happen which the deal will probably happen because we have a lot of weak people that are going to approve that deal just like they approved Obamacare. You know, you elected people who would knock out Obamacare. They got to Washington. Something happened. I promise it is not going to happen to me. Something happens in Washington. They get elected. They're really going to do a job. They are all. We're going to end Obamacare. We're going to fight. We are going to end this horrible thing with the $5 billion Web site that doesn't work to this day, by the way, $5 billion. I have about 40 websites that cost me $3 and they work. So we're going to end Obamacare. You probably elected some of them of they go to Washington. I don't know. There is something about Washington. They look at the beautiful buildings, these beautiful halls. And all of a sudden, they become impotent. Is that an appropriate word? I think so. They become just, it doesn't work. Put those two together. Something happens to them. And all of a sudden they're not fighters. I think they're so impressed. They show their wives. Look where I'm working. I'm working in Congress. Of course I have to vote for Obamacare. Isn't it wonderful? Look what I am doing. But they got elected to knock it out. What happened to these people? What happened? So something happens when people get elected and go to Washington. The beauty of Washington. I'm building as you know, the old post office. Can you imagine? President Obama is in charge of government services who are tremendous people, by the way. They really are. They are very talented people. That's because they chose me. If they didn't choose me, I probably wonderful say that. But they are talented. They are great people. Now, we're doing a great hotel, one of the greatest hotels. I think it will be one of the greatest hotels anywhere in the world. But think of it. Everybody wanted it. One of the most sought after pieces of property right smack on Pennsylvania between Congress and the White House. Best location. You know, for the real estate people, they notice that any time you get a post office, it's good. You know, the post office was always there first. I have the old post office in Washington, DC So it is being converted to Trump international. It is going to be great. And just think of that. I got it from the Obama administration. To this day, I say, are you sure we got that? I tell you. But we're doing a great job. And here's the thing. We are head of , think of this. Compare this to government. We're way ahead of schedule. And we're under budget. Did you ever hear that before? You don't hear that. So we have a great country. We have a country with tremendous potential. The potentials here are people. We have great people. We have problems all over the place, but they're problem that's can be solved. We have to incentivize people. We have to give people spirit. When President Obama was elected, one thing I thought would happen, I really thought he would be a unifier. You look at Baltimore, you look at Ferguson, you look at St. Louis the other night, you look at Chicago, you look at so many different places, and you look at what's happening with the African American youth. It has never been in worse shape. Never. You look at what's happening with so many other aspects of our country. And there's a racial divide, there is a divide, period. There's hatred all over the country. I've never seen it like this. We have to unify the country. We have to spiritize the country. We have to create jobs. We have to do a tremendous amount of work. But it can be done quickly. I will say this. If the right person is not elected, come next year, I don't know if it can be brought back again no matter how confident and capable the person is. It is going to be too far down the line. No, it is going to be too far down the line. So just in closing, and you know, normally I would do questions. But this has been such a good time and everyone has heard such a brilliant speech. And you know, I was with Elton John. Anybody like Elton John? And a lot of times, like he'll do this last song. And it is so great. It is so unbelievable. The place is standing and roaring and going incredible. And then they'll be like, they'll come back for like three more, right? And the three are not as good as the last one. And people go, let's get out of here. So you know, you like to leave on a high note. And I just like to say this is a great audience. But I have, thank you. I love you too. Thank you. But you know, I have a statement. I say it all the time. And I told the story once before. And it is that the American dream is dead. But I'm going to make it bigger and better and stronger than before. Right? Good. But I got home one night. And my wife said that was such a terrible thing you said. It was all over television. And the problem I have with television, look. They're all live. What do I do? Every night I'm on live television. I suppose to make speeches. How do you make the same speech? I'm trying to change it up. But every night, CNN, FOX, NBC, everybody. Look at them. They're all live. It's not fair. No, no. These other guys, they go around, they make a speech in front of 21 people. Nobody cares. They make the , they read the same speech. They have Teleprompters. I say we should outlaw Teleprompters for anybody, right? For anybody, for anybody running for president. You how easy that would be? Instead of this. I'm working my ass off. OK? Instead of this I can just stand up. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much, it's wonderful to be in Iowa. You know, everybody is going to fall sleep and half an hour we leave. No mistakes. No problems. But I walk in but they are always live, these guys. I think we are going, let's start canceling them a little bit. And by the way, they're getting phenomenal ratings. That's why they're live. They're getting phenomenal ratings. And you know, the old days, when I was with the Apprentice, they paid me a lot of money. They don't pay me anything. You know, for the debate, we had 24 million people. Now, normally there would be like two million people, right? When you say two million if they are lucky. They had 24. I won't take credit for but believe me, 100 percent it's me, 100 percent. It's true. It's true. So the ratings came out. They were so big and so, it was the biggest rating in the history of cable television or something like that. And you know, I was a little obvious, but that is OK. So it happens. I'm saying to myself well, if it's not me, I should go to CNN. They're doing the next debate. And I should I say that Jeff Zucker, a great guy, Jeff, I'm going to do the debate but I want $10 million for charity. American cancer society, AIDS research. We'll pick ten great, a million. Otherwise I'm not going to the debate. And honestly, I think they would pay me. I do. I'm, 100 percent for charity. But it might not look right, I don't know, Ann. I'm going to have to think about it. I sort of like it. Does anybody like that idea? Then we go to Roger Ailes. He is a great guy at FOX and we say Roger, you know, they did so great at CNN. You did so great at FOX. Let's make it like 12, 15, 18, all for charity. But I'm thinking about it, I am thinking about it, believe me. So I go home, my wife says to me, you know, what are you doing? What are you doing? It was a horrible thing you said. I said, why? What did I say? You said the American dream is dead. I said, I didn't say that. I turned on the television. TiVo is wonderful. I turn it on and they have it cut. It is the American dream is dead. Cut. I said, what a terrible statement. But what I do say, and I say it all the time, the American dream is to a large extent, it is in trouble, but we're going to make it bigger and better and stronger than ever before. And, and we are going to win the nomination, and we are going to get the greatest people that have ever represented, we'll get the smartest, toughest, best people to represent us against the world. And we are going to make our country so great again, you're going to be so proud of it. And it is an honor to be with you tonight, and I really look forward to being with you for many, many years to come. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Donald Trump finishing a speech in Dubuque, Iowa. It lasted more than 50 minutes, walking off to Twisted Sister, We're not Going to Take It, the theme song there. Hello, everyone. I'm John Berman, sitting in for Anderson tonight. What a night it was in Dubuque, where in addition to this 50 plus minute speech, Donald Trump also gave a news conference, and man, were there fireworks there. Univision anchor Jorge Ramos got bounced, thrown out of the room, then invited back. There were more shots as well from Mr. Trump aimed at Jeb Bush. A lot to talk about tonight, so let's bring in our panel. Amanda Carpenter, former communications director for Senator Ted Cruz. Republican strategist Alex Castellanos. Republican consultant and former top Trump campaign adviser, Roger Stone, and CNN political commentator Peter Beinart, who also teaches journalism and political science at the City University of New York and is a contributing editor for Atlantic Media. Amanda, let me start with you, let's start on the speech. We have a lot to go over tonight, including Jorge Ramos getting thrown out of the news conference. But let's start with the speech. 50 minutes, hit a lot of subjects. Another way to say it is it was rambling. He talked about Iran, he talked about immigration, he talked about the economy, he talked about China and he talked about The Apprentice. What struck you? Thank you very much. I see these beautiful teleprompters. Believe me, I'm not using them. You know I said if you run for president you should not be allowed to use teleprompters. Get these things out of here. I was watching Hillary making a speech and it was outside. And they were dead, dark, big. They weren't even like this. These are clears. I can almost see right through them, but, which really is disturbing. Is that disturbing to the audience, wouldn't you think? But hers, because it was outside, were black, and they were twice the size. I said what kind of a speech is that? That's not a speech. Most importantly, I brought my Bible. Okay? And, you know, it's First Presbyterian Church, Jamaica. And this was written by my mother with my name, with, it was a long time ago, with my name, with my address, with everything. In case I lost it, somebody would return it. You know, in the old days, if you lost something, they returned it; today a little bit less so. But I saw this and I said I have to bring it and just show it, because it brings back so many memories. It's really an honor to be here. And, you know, David is a fantastic guy. He's done an amazing job. And we had some big news today with Boehner. And, you know, I've been saying for a long time, and I was just telling, actually, David, who said, by the way, I'm not a politician and I'm not politically correct. And I think that's a great thing. I just am so tired. I'm so tired of the political, I love this guy over here. Thank you. I'm so tired of the time and the effort of all of this. We don't have time. We have a country that's in such danger and such trouble. To be politically correct, every word is measured. And I can do it. I went to great schools. I went to an Ivy League school. So easy to do it. But who wants to do it? We have to get to business. I mean, we have to just get back to business. But we're going to have a very interesting period of time. And maybe it starts today, because Speaker Boehner, you know, some people like him on a personal basis. Do people like him on a personal basis? Anybody? You know, we want to see, we want to see the job being done properly. We want to see, we want people that are going to get it done. And I don't understand. They get elected. They're full of vim and vigor. They're going to change things. They're going to get rid of Obamacare. They're going to do all of these things. They come down to these magnificent vaulted ceilings that you see all over Washington. And what happens? They become different people. They become different people. They come out and they don't do it. And I will say, you know, for the groups that want to take what they say is a harsh tone, I wrote The Art of the Deal. And I will tell you, The Art of the Deal, if they would have read it, some of, and I'm talking about the Republicans. We know where the Democrats are coming from. But we are so disappointed in the Republican establishment, because if they stuck together, in all fairness, you have a certain group of 10 percent, 12 percent of Republicans that are out there fighting, fighting. But when the other side, which is Obama and the Democrats, when they hear that they're not going to win and they have no support, there's no way, from The Art of the Deal, there's no way that they can possibly win, that the Republicans can win. So they're out there. They're left hanging so many different times. If they actually were unified, if they were brought together and unified, and you said four very important things that you're going to take very, very strong, harsh measures, you're going to win, because nobody's going to, in 50 years from now, in 100 years from now, in two years from now, and even next month, nobody's going to be talking about the speaker. Nobody's going to be talking about any of the, they're going to be saying let's say something very important. The government shut down. They're blaming the president, folks. They're blaming the president. And, you know, it's sort of interesting. When you hear the Democrats, they're very, very good, very, very good. They go, oh, we want the government to shut down. We want it to shut down. That would be so great if it shut down. It would be so wonderful if it shut down. And the Republicans say, oh, they want it to shut down. Oh, that would be bad. We're playing right into their hands. These people are babies. Do you remember when they said they want to impeach, do you remember, no, they're babies. They're babies. Do you remember when they said they wanted to impeach, a small group wanted to impeach Obama? Right? Remember? And then the Democrats said, no, no, we want him to be impeached. We want him to be impeached. Please impeach him. It would be so good for him. It will make him look so good. And he'll get all of his points out. It'll be wonderful. Do you really think they want him to be impeached? So the Republicans come back. I was just telling the folks backstage, the Republicans come back. Oh, we don't want to do that because he wants to be. Who wants to be impeached? Oh, it's so sad. I mean, you know, like, you have this clown, Marco Rubio. I've been so nice to him. I've been so nice. I've been so nice. And then, no, but he's in favor of immigration, and he has been. He has been. It was the gang of eight. And you remember the gang of eight. It was terrible. And then he went down in the polls. And you have to stay. You know what? If you believe in something, you have to be true to yourself. You have to be. You have to be. But it was the gang of eight and it was really, really, you talk about weak on immigration; nobody weaker. And all of a sudden he goes down in the polls and all of a sudden he starts changing his tone. But you never really change your tone. You remember that. And also, when you're elected senator, you have to go and vote. It's so important. You can't say I can't vote. And he's got the worst record. And he hit me. And I said why is he doing that? And sometimes the Republicans do it more than anybody because they want to sort of catch on. They want to get into the publicity cycle. And all you're doing is hurting yourselves. I mean, it's a bad thing. All you're doing is hurting yourselves. Now, we have so many people that can be and should be attacked. We have a president that is extremely bad for everything that the folks in this room stand for, I mean, extremely bad. You know, freedom of religion, so important. We just don't see it. You know, you take a look at a thing like the Iran deal. We talk freedom of religion, look at the Iran, how long is this whole thing going to last when we have incompetent people, grossly incompetent people negotiating these vital deals like that deal where 24 days and all, I don't have to go over all of the many problems with the deal. Even Israel, Israel is in such trouble with this deal. And you know in that deal probably it says, and nobody even understands what says, which is a problem, but probably if Israel ever attacked Iran, we're supposed to come to their defense. Do we know that? Nobody's able to tell us what is going on with respect to that. If Israel has to, because at some point something might happen. The deal is horrible. The deal is horrible, from any standpoint. And we have to do something. And I can say it's going to have to be renegotiated. You know, I've made a living of buying bad, I love bad deals, because you buy them cheap, do you understand that? You buy them cheap. I love horrible contracts. I love buying, I bought them from friends of mine. I buy a horrible, horrible contract. The poor guy is dying with it. He's getting killed. I buy it cheap. I then go and fight like hell and make it a great contract. Sometimes you chapter it, some, you do lots of different things, whatever you have to do. And you make it a great contract. That contract, that agreement has to be changed. We have no choice, because if it isn't you're going to have nuclear proliferation, it's already happening. You're going to have potentially the destruction of Israel. It has to be changed. One of the things in that contract that I cannot believe, we're giving them $150 billion dollars. Right? No, we're giving them $150 billion dollars of which they're going to use, and already are using, they're ordering missiles from Russia. They're doing things that probably and definitely we can't allow them to do. But they're doing it. We cannot allow the incompetence that we've had going on in this country. We just can't, we have to use our greatest negotiations. We have to use our smartest people. We use political hacks, they're all political hacks. They're negotiating deals that they should, they have no right doing it. Take a look at another thing, one thing, and, look, nuclear's so important, but you have four prisoners. One of them's over there because he's a Christian. He's over in jail because he's a Christian. Now, at the beginning of the negotiation, by the way, it used to be three at the beginning, now it's four. But you say very simply before you start, fellas, and by the way I have to say, to the women, it's all fellas over there. They haven't figured out that women are smarter than men. They haven't figured this out yet. A little detail. They'll figure. It'll take another 150 years, but they'll figure it. You say, fellas, you got to give us back our prisoners. You got to do it. You got to do it. No, you got to do it. You got to give us back our prisoners. Now, they went to Kerry who is, you know, broke his leg playing, this guy's in a bicycle race, can you believe it? He's in a bicycle race. He's got the hat. He's got the emblem. I said, what's he doing? He as actually in a race. It wasn't just like let's get a little exercise. Breaks his leg. This is our negotiator, all right? So he walks in, he walks in with crutches. And they say, what the hell is with this guy? Is he crazy? We have to very simply, as an example, that example. You walk in at the beginning, not the end, not the end. You say, fellas, before we start, you have four prisoners. You don't want them. We do. It would send a great signal to the American people. It'll make the deal much easier. You'll make another deal. It'll make it much easier. You got to give us back. If they say no, you take a walk because you know you're not going to get anything. You take a walk. You take a walk. And I guarantee you, I guarantee you, as sure as you're sitting there, that within a short period of time they call back, you have your prisoners, you have them. But here's the worst, it isn't even, and you need the right messenger. If I'm the messenger, you get those prisoners back. I tell you what, I tell you what, I'll make this statement. If I get elected president, before I ever get to office, I guarantee you they will be back, I guarantee 100 percent. A hundred, that's a hundred percent. But you need the right messenger. And in the case of the prisoners, they never even asked. Can you believe it? They said, both Obama and Kerry said we didn't want to complicate the negotiations. No, no, I mean, this was really a statement. We don't want to complicate. So it's time. I'm a business man. I made a tremendous amount of money, a tremendous amount. It's ridiculous. I mean, I don't even believe it myself. You want to know the truth? I don't even believe it. I'm self funding, I don't want to have the lobbyists and the special interests put money into my campaign. I'm turning down, by the way, I'm turning down millions of dollars. I've turned down millions and millions of dollars. I actually feel foolish because it's so anti me. It' so, like, it's not me. But I turn down millions and millions. And yet, you know, I was in Iowa two weeks ago. And I had a great audience. We had a, we've had just such great people and great crowds. And I said to the people, do you mind if I take millions of dollars? I promise you I won't do anything for the people giving me the money? Do you mind? And they all stood up and they said no, no, no. It was really important. I didn't know it was going to be that important. Anyway, I think self funding's great. I'm the only one that's self funding. Everyone else, believe me, whether it's Bush, who by the way, along with Rubio, but whether it's Bush or anybody in favor of common core. I mean, I think of it. Now, you talk from a Christian standpoint. You want local school representation. You want local. Common Core is a disaster. But you people that really are tough and smart. You look at another thing, trade. That's what I'm, oh, I'm going to do so good. I always say I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. That I tell you. That I tell you. You know, people say, and actually, CNN did a poll and I come out so high on that, on the economy. And by the way, like much, much higher, not even close. I come out the highest by far on that. And leadership, I come out high on leadership. And I come out high on really other categories. Then I say, if I'm so high in all these categories, why do we even have to have an election, right? Why? Why? But a woman stood up, because I didn't sue, you know, the one thing I was a little weak on, people were not sure I was a nice person. And I am. I am. I am. I am, I'm a giving person. I believe in God. I believe in the Bible. I'm a Christian. I'm, you know, I have a lot of reasons. I love, I love people. But the woman stood up. She said, Mr. Trump, I'm a big fan of yours and I'm going to vote for you, but I don't know if you're nice enough to get elected. I said, I really think I'm a nice person, but let me tell you something: I really think this is going to be an election based on competence. We need now competence. And we have to have something. We, we need help. We owe China $1.5 trillion. Think of it. They suck our money out, they take our jobs, they do everything, and we owe them money. How does that work? Not so good. No, we owe them. Supposed to be the other way around, right? Japan. We owe them the exact same amount, $1.5 trillion. They sell us cars, biggest boats you've ever seen coming into the harbors. You've never seen boats, I've never seen ships like this. They're loaded, loaded with cars. So they send millions of cars over here. We sell them beef, beef. They don't want it. Half the time they send it back. They want to send it back. The farmers over there don't want it. So we take it back. That's not good beef by the time you get it back. I said the other day, no, no, I say it's aged; now they call it Kobe beef and we sell it for more money, you know, it's one of the,. But, but you look at the imbalance, the US trade, I mean, look at, look at the US trade. China, almost $400 billion a year we lose. Japan, $75 billion a year. Mexico, they all say the fence. First of all, we are going to build a wall, and it's going to be a real wall, OK? If people like it or don't, we're going to build a wall. And it's going to have a big, beautiful door, and people are coming to come into the country, but they're going to come in legally. They're going to come into the country legally. And when people graduate number one in their class from Harvard and Yale, we don't send them out. And they want to stay in the country. You know, there was a case the other day I read about where somebody, a great student at a great school, couldn't stay. From India, couldn't stay in the country, no matter what. And they forced him out. And he founded a company a few years ago in India, 5000 employees, one of the most successful companies, an unbelievable job. We could have had him here, and we force them out. Silicon Valley needs people. We all need people. But we force these incredible people that have been in our system for years, we force them out. They graduate, boom, get out. So we've got to be smart. We've got to be tough. We can't allow our veterans to be treated the way they're treated. They're treated horribly. They're treated horribly. And our military? If I win, we're going to make our military so big, so strong, so powerful nobody will ever mess with us, folks. We are really in serious trouble. You have, you have Putin the other day, not so long ago, saying, you know, they better be careful, we have nuclear missiles. I've never heard, you know, coming from Russia. But you have North Korea, you have so many other places. I brought up recently, you know, during the debate, anybody watch the debate, by any chance? How did I do? How did I do? Right? I won every single poll, and yet these media people, oh, Donald Trump didn't, I won every poll. I won Drudge. I love Drudge. I love Drudge. But I won Drudge. I won Time magazine. I won every single poll, Slate, places I never even heard of. I won every poll. Then I turn on the television and even, I think the Fox poll had me at second, and they, they wouldn't say it. They wouldn't tell. They wouldn't say I was in second. Other polls, they said I did great. Then I'm listening to some of the pundits. I won't use their name, because actually some of them are getting better, you know, as I get higher and higher. We're doing great. In fact, with Evangelicals in Iowa, just came out, I'm number one at 29 percent, substantially ahead of anyone else. I'm happy about that. You know why? That's the reason. That's the reason. But, but we have to be careful, as Christians. The progressives are pushing, the progressives are pushing to an extent that, if we're not careful, we're going to have some big problems, and even bigger than we have right now. Look, we need people that can support us. We need people that are strong and smart and can back us. The word Christmas, I love Christmas. I love Christmas. You go to stores now, you don't see the word Christmas. It says Happy Holidays all over. I say, where's Christmas? I tell my wife: don't go to those stores. I want to see Christmas. No, I want to see Christmas. And you know, other people can have their holidays, no. But Christmas is Christmas. I want to see Merry Christmas. Remember the expression Merry Christmas? You don't see it anymore. You're going to see it if I get elected, I can tell you right now. I can tell you right now. So I just want to thank you for the, it's been an amazing group of people. You've been amazing. And to have such a fantastic room. But I just want to thank everybody. You know, I got into this and everyone said, there's no way he'll ever do it, he's got this wonderful company, he's got, I do. I have a wonderful life. But I see what's happening. I see what's happening with the country. I see so many things going wrong, so many things that are caused really by incompetence, that can be straightened out. We can straighten it out fairly quickly. I will tell you if we don't stop it now, however, it's going to be, at some point it's going to be too late. You're not going to be able to turn it. You're not going to be able to turn it. But I got in and they said, you know, he'll never do it. So I did it. They all said, oh, he did it. Then they'll say, he'll never file, like, form A, which is basically a single page where you're signing your life away. I signed it. I signed form A. They said, oh, I don't believe it. Then they said he'll never put in his financials because maybe he's not as big financially as everybody thinks. I put in my, almost a hundred pages, like the biggest ever filed by far, by far, and I had it ahead of, but you know, they said, oh, he'll ask for all the extensions. And you had some of the politicians asking for extensions and they were one page. I put it in ahead of schedule, and it turned out the company was much bigger than anybody thought, much stronger. It was, it's an amazing company, right? So they said, this guy might be running. Then I go with the polls, and the polls go up just like the Evangelicals in Iowa. The polls, I start, bing, bing, bing, bing. And every single two or three weeks, when the polls come out, they said, well, now he's reached his cap. I started at 6 percent. It went to 9 percent. It went to 12 percent. It was like a rocket ship, right? You've seen it. I mean, I'm not telling you anything. And, and it went to 20 percent and it went to 22 percent. Then it went, and then the other day, in a Fox poll, it went up 2 percent. And I'm killing everybody. And they say, other people are surging, Trump is staying still. But I'm up! I went up. I didn't stay still. I went up 2 points, right, a big two points. And I had another one where I'm 33 percent, 33 percent, and the next one I think was like 12 percent or 15 percent, and they don't want to report it. They don't put the poll out. I said, why aren't you putting the poll out? Well, we don't like that poll. This is a great poll. It's a great poll. And they wouldn't put it out. So, you know, I get angry at these things, because you know what I like? I like fairness. Somebody said, do you have thin skin? I don't. If I'm wrong about something, I don't mind, the media can do whatever they want. But I have thin skin when I'm right about something when I know they're doing a number on all of us, because when I ran, and the reason I ran is because I want to make this country great again. And we're going to do it. We're going to do it. And we're going to do it a lot faster and a lot better than anybody thinks is possible. And I just want to thank everybody. You're special people and I love you all. And this is the key. Thank you all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much, everybody. I guarantee you that young woman who just got taken out after interrupting us three times, I guarantee the cameras will be on her. I guarantee. It's disgusting, disgusting. So we're taking about the media, and by the way some of the media's terrific. But most of it, seventy percent, seventy five percent is absolute dishonest, absolute scum. Remember that scum! They're totally dishonest people. I had one the other day where I finished a speech and they said, Oh, Trump was interrupted and he left early. Like, uh, I spoke for forty five, fifty minutes. I then answered question, questions. And then I went around to you know, everybody knew it was false. Amazingly there's a media group that calls the media. And the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC. She's back there little Katy she's back there. What a lie it was, no, what a lie, Katy Tur, what a lie it was from NBC to have written that, it was a total lie. And they did a story where they, I didn't know they had a group like this, where they actually criticized the media and they said it was a total lie. And I love you, I love you, I love you. And then other people pick it up, you know it's NBC so somebody picks it up. Third rate reporter, remember that, third rate, third. It's possible. It's possible. Look, my whole campaign is about honesty. We have a problem. People said, Oh, that's not politically correct, what he said about surveillance. But we have to have some surveillance. You had to see the whole speech. It was so good. That was when Carson went down. That was the thing that totally took him down. In Iowa, big audience. No, that may have been the beginning of the end but my speech is when he really began to go down. I talked about his book and in his book he says he has pathological disease. I mean, he actually says it. There's no cure for it. I compared it to a child molester because there is no cure for child molesting, other than , well, you know. Nobody. Then I talked about taking the lock at his friend's face, taking a hammer to his mother's head. Then about the belt. You didn't see the whole speech. That's the problem with what I did and won't do again. You saw what I said and it was fine. You have to see the whole speech to understand. I started talking about it and explaining, and then I showed how it doesn't work that way. I moved over and took the belt, demonstrated what I meant. People there got it. What they do, the dishonest press does, is one second of me playing with my belt. People go, What the fuck is he doing? They don't know it was about the knife going into the belt. They haven't seen the whole speech and what I was saying about how a belt doesn't stop a knife. I was showing a knife, a knife going into a belt isn't stopped by the belt. So, if you watch the speech, it took down Carson. That was the beginning of the end for Carson. I figured I had to do it. You know the expression in golf: Johnny, he's just hanging around. The guy was just hanging around. I couldn't understand it. He was just hanging around. It's fine when you put them both in. You can't put in just the one. That's only fair. I'm a deal guy. I've been winning all of my life. Like this property. I bought it six, seven years ago. I bought it for a steal. Eight hundred acres on the Potomac River. I bought it for nothing. I could sell it for anything. I'm not selling, but I could sell it for anything. My whole life is about winning. I always win. I win at golf. I'm a club champion many times at different clubs. I win at golf. I can sink the three footer on the 18th hole when others can't. My whole life is about winning. I don't lose often. I almost never lose. In Massachusetts, I'm at 48 percent. You know why? Tom Brady said Trump's the greatest. He says it to anyone who asks him. You know, it's hard for a guy like him to say that. When you're a football player, you don't want to be taking sides in campaigns and having the Hillary Clinton people now say you're not as good as Bart Starr. You understand. So Tom Brady is great. Hey, look. I went through a depression, a real estate depression that was massive in 1990. The last one I made a lot of money because I was a buyer , like I bought this at the bottom of the market. I can tell , I'm so good at real estate, I've made billions of dollars. Tell me the day you bought the property and I'll tell you if you made a good deal. I made such a mistake with Chuck Todd because I told such a truthful , he asked me would I ever get out? I thought, Huh? I'm leading in all of the polls. Would you ever get out? I said, Look, if for some reason that I wasn't leading in the polls, that I wasn't getting the acclaim or the biggest audiences , and I'm getting the biggest crowds by far, much bigger than Bernie Sanders ever had. Nobody reports that, but anyway. We had 12000 people in Sarasota at 12 o'clock on a Saturday. Last night, we had a group in Manassas, they were so packed in. They couldn't get them in. You saw. So, I said to Chuck, honestly, if I'm down and not getting crowds, if I was down in the polls. I'm a believer in the polls by the way. Rarely do you see a poll that's very far off. Let me just say That interview was a couple of months ago. If I see that I'm not going to win, I'd get out. I'm not a masochist. I go home and I see my wife. She's always a good critic. She says, That was a great answer. Other people say the same. He hated it. I said, What's wrong? The only one who hated it was Corey. He was going like, Oh shit. But I quickly understood why. He was right. The next day, the headlines: Trump may leave race. He's a good guy, really good guy. Say hello to him for me, will you? You know, his best golf story ever was about Mike Donald, who almost won the 1990 US Open. He was leading the US Open going into the final hole. He was an early starter. A rabbit. In other words, he was a good golfer who never made $10, who was on the tour for 10 years. Leading the US Open. Had a great final round but he was in the middle of the pack. Two hours to go and everyone said he was going to win the US Open. He wasn't supposed to win the US Open because he was a rabbit. Jack Nicklaus, all the others, they're the kind of guys who usually win. So he's in the clubhouse, leading the US Open, everyone's doing great, watching it on TV. And then Hale Irwin goes crazy on the course. You remember? Irwin goes to the 18th hole, he's one down to Mike Donald, who no one had ever heard of. And Hale Irwin sinks a 97 foot putt. That was the one where he ran around the green. Now Irwin has the privilege of playing Donald in a playoff the following day. A full 18 hole playoff. Hale Irwin, naturally, wins because the other guy never wins. The champion always wins. Bamberger did one of the greatest stories ever on that. The next day they show Mike Donald, two pictures. One has him on Sunday and Monday, Mike Donald playing to thousands of people up and down the fairway, 20 rows deep, as he walks up the 18th hole at the US Open. Pictures. The next day, he doesn't win, he's seen walking up a fairway, nobody there, no money, his wife carrying the bag. If he had won, it'd have been a life changing experience. But he didn't win. Those pictures, famous, I remember them. A thing like that is always a possibility. It's never happened because I've been having this for a long time. I write a book, it becomes the Number One selling business book of all time. The Art of the Deal. All of my books have done well. The current book does well I don't even have time to promote it. Have I spent 10 minutes promoting it? I didn't take three weeks off, going all over the place to promote it. You sell thousands of books a day if you do that. So the book, the show. The Apprentice had some great run, it was the Number One show. What a lot of people don't realize is that I gave up a lot to do this not just deals but a two hour primetime television show for another two years. Don't kid yourself. I've always been there. In school, I was always successful. In life, I was always successful. My father was a successful real estate developer and he was a very tough man but a good man. My father would always praise me. He always thought I was the smartest person. He said to one of the big magazines that everything he touches turns to gold. At a very young age. So I don't know. It's the thing that number one, it's my hair. Number two, what don't people really understand? Those are the two questions I always get. Number one, my hair is real. It's me. I've seen these old pictures, I combed it the same way. Okay. I have a friend, Bill Zanker, who's a very smart guy. He said, If you didn't go through those difficulties in the early 1990s, when the press was just tearing you apart, you wouldn't be nearly as big as you are now. Again, I never went bankrupt, but I went through a lot, owed billions and billions of dollars. The press loved it, they were killing me, not talking about other people. I said to him, That's wrong. He said, No. If you didn't fight through it and become bigger than ever, you'd never be as big as you are now. Interesting thought. That's his feeling. I'm not sure if I agree. But you understand what he's saying. It showed a human something. Tell your son I think I'm a very nice person who gets along very well with people. I'm very loyal, to a fault. My wife said, You're too nice too long and then when you go bad, then you're too bad. Then she said, You get too vicious and you never forgive. You put up with too much too long. You get screwed by somebody. You're too nice, and then you flip, it's too long, too nasty, too horrible. Wow. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. We start by paying our great respects to Pearl Harbor. We don't want that stuff. We don't want World Trade Centers. We don't want that ever happen to us again. It's not going to happen to us again. So I want to thank everybody for being here. It's a great honor. They have thousands of people outside and sometimes they'll say Would you like to wait about an hour until they all come in? But we can't get them in anyways so what difference there. We all got lucky. We're together tonight. Thank you. So we have a lot of big news today. To me, very big was CNN just came out with a new poll about an hour ago and Iowa, great, great state, and in Iowa, Trump 33 percent. Beating everybody by a lot. You have Cruz at 20 percent and Carson at 16 percent and going down and Rubio at 11 percent and Bush at 4 percent. But it's Trump at 33 percent. It just came out. It's Iowa, we love Iowa. By the way, great ship named after Iowa too. I've been on that one too. A really great one. The other big poll that came out just two days ago was the national poll. Trump 36 percent and then I won't even mention the other numbers because they're so low. You know, when you have so many people running, we had 17 and then they started to drop. Ding. Bing. I love it. I love it. And you'll be losing a lot over the next little while. I would imagine. I don't know. When somebody's down at zero I would think that eventually they'll drop out. The only difference is there's nothing to pick up if there is zero. What do you pick up? So anyways you'll be seeing that. One of the things I think that's so important because to me very important in the same poll, which is the big national CNN poll, on the economy, so important, Trump 55 percent. Everyone else nothing. On the budget, I'm really good at these things, economy, budgets. I sort of expected this. On the budget, Trump, this is with 15 people remaining, Trump 51 percent. Everyone else bing. Oh, here's one that I started and I took a lot of heat. I took a lot of heat. Sort of like the one we're talking about today. I guess you've heard a little bit about it. But I've taken a lot of heat on this one. Illegal immigration. Now, had I not brought that up in Trump Tower in June when I announced that I was going to run for president, which takes courage to run for president, believe me. You know, all of my life, I've heard that if you're a successful person, especially if you have very success, you've done a lot of things, a lot of deals, a lot of everything, you can't run for president. And yet, that's the kind of mindset and thinking this country needs. We're being run by people that don't know what they're doing. Very sad. On illegal immigration, Trump 48 percent. That's with 15 people. Everyone else, no good. On a thing called ISIS, oh, don't worry. We'll have plenty, we'll talk a lot about ISIS. Can you believe it? Here we have generals. They go on television and talk. They do all talk. You people, a lot of military people here. Who's military here? All right, I love you. By the way, speaking of it, we're going to make our military so strong, so powerful, so great, nobody's ever going to mess with us again. Nobody. They're never going to mess with us. You know in many ways, it's the cheapest thing we can do. The cheapest thing. Instead of fighting these wars that we don't know what we're doing and we have leaders that are afraid to do anything, we're going to make it so great, so strong that people, gosh, they're not messing. They're not messing. And we're going to take care of our great vets, our wounded warriors. We're going to take care of them. Because they, thank you, they are not being taken care of. We have illegal immigrants that are taken care of better than our incredible veterans and it's not going to happen any longer. Not going to happen. Not going to happen. So with ISIS, Trump 46 percent. Can you imagine that? With all of these characters running. On foreign policy, Trump way up. And you know, in theory you could say Well, maybe it's not my thing. But people want to see strong, they want to see strength, they want to see protection, they want to be protected. And that's it. I watched last night and I watched the president truly that didn't know what he was doing. He didn't know why he was there. He refuses to use the term radical Islamic terrorism. He refuses to use the term. I don't even know if he knows what the hell is going on. I really don't. And then we're looking at Hillary Clinton. Honestly, I know Hillary. It's just going to be an extension of Obama. I think maybe worse. She's got no strength. She's got no stamina. Remember that. You don't need a president with no strength or stamina when we're being ripped off on trade, we're being ripped off on Obamacare, which is going to be repealed and replaced by something really good. When our soldiers aren't being taken care of, when our military is never been like it is today. One of the generals was on television, as usual, saying that we're the least prepared now than anytime that he's ever seen it and he's been there a long time retiring. That's how we are. In the most dangerous world we've ever had because of the power of weapons, we have people that don't know, they don't, I'm telling you. I watch them. I watch these generals being interviewed. Do you think Gen. George Patton would be interviewed? , They'd be interviewed after total and complete victory. Gen. Douglas MacArthur. They're not big for interviews. You know, they shoot first, they talk later. These guys, and I don't think we'll have to. You know, just so you understand, Bush, Bush, he said yesterday he was being interviewed, he said that he was talking about me. He was saying the nicest things about me. Of course, he says he'll be elected. He's at what 3 percent? Right? No, but he said some things and I was like, I said Who says that about an opponent? You don't say those things. You'll find out what he said. But he said very nice things. But, if you look at what happens where he is upset with me because he says the tone, the tone, of Donald Trump is not nice. And I say it all the time. We have people whose heads are being chopped off in the Middle East because they're Christian and for other reasons. They're being dumped and drowned in steel cages. And we talk about my tone. Hillary said the same thing. Mr. Trump's tone is not nice. These people are living in a different planet. Different planet. And remember what I said about Hillary. We need somebody who's strong. We need somebody with incredible energy but incredible intelligence and all of those things. You know, I know a lot of tough people but they're not smart. That's no good. They're easy. We need tough. We need smart. We need like every character. We are so far behind the eight ball in this country. We owe $19 trillion. The budget they signed two weeks ago is going to make it $21 trillion. It's a, think of it. Trillion. Trillion. Trillion dollars. Who the hell ever heard of the word 10 years ago? There was no such word. We owe $21 trillion in the very near future. We're really in trouble. We have to rebuild our country. We have to rebuild our infrastructure. We have to rebuild our military. And yet, we do deals with China where there's a trade imbalance of over $400 billion a year in their favor, by the way, in case you had any question. Japan, they send their cars by the millions. $70 billion a year imbalance. That's like a loss. You look at Mexico. We're going to build a wall. It will be a real wall. It will be a real wall. Gonna happen. It's gonna happen. The people I'm dealing with, and you know, I really focus on Hillary later because I have to get through these 15 people. You know, there's 15 of us. I had Perry came at me strong; he went down. I had Gov. Walker, nice guy, he went down. Every guy that attacks me so far they've all gone down. We've got to keep it that way, right? I mean, Lindsey Graham. He's at zero. He's at zero. Zero. Let me ask you a question. I don't get Lindsey Graham. I don't get him, He's literally at zero. You see him. And he keeps talking. He gets so much television. I mean, he's on television all the time and he doesn't go up. He's at zero, folks. His ideas are so bad. I'm more militaristic than him. But I know how to win; he doesn't. He just wants to attack everything. He doesn't know where the hell, ha ha. And he always sits with John McCain. It's like they're the Bobbsey twins. They're always sitting together. No, it's true. Do you ever notice? Sometimes I want to see him by himself. He's always sitting with John McCain, who's fine. I'm not knocking it. But you got to know what to do. Now me, I was against the war in Iraq. So everyone says, you have the right temperament, I have a great temperament. But you've got to attack. If you've got to do something, you've got to know what you're doing. I said if you attack Iraq and you wipe it out, Iran is going to take over the entire Middle East because you're going to ruin the balance. It was so simple to me. And actually they sent a group from the White House to see me because I got so much publicity, so much publicity that they sent a group from the White House to see Mr. Trump. I said, Fellas, you're going to have Iran take over the Middle East and that's what's happening. And Iran's going to take over Iraq as sure as you're sitting there. And by the way, Iraq, with the second largest oil reserves anywhere in the world. We lost of thousands of lives. We have wounded warriors all over the place. $2 trillion. We have nothing. We got nothing. We have absolutely nothing. And we left. And we have a president, we shouldn't have been there but then we shouldn't have left the way we left. You know, the funny thing is I look at Democrats and liberals and conservatives and Republicans, wouldn't it be good all of us if we can get together and really make our country great again? Is that what we want to do? I'll bet you that if I spoke to that young woman, that quickly I really think I can convince her that we're all in this together, folks. We want to have a strong country. Right? But you know, if you think about it and you'll have some that can never be satisfied no matter what. They're just troublemakers, et cetera, et cetera. But most people aren't and they believe something. And I have some very smart friends don't agree with me; they agree with the other side. But I really believe that if you took it about making America great, we have to be strong, we have to be vigilant, and if we're not vigilant, that was the same person. I've got to tell you, so far, the security is not doing a great job in here, I'll tell you that. That was the same person. You can do very nice but why don't you get her out because honestly it's inappropriate. So security, strengthen yourself up. See, our country has this kind of security. That's the problem we have, Treat her very nicely please but she should now be taken out. Same person. One person. It's one person. They let her out. They gave her a second chance and the same thing happens. But you would think that everybody we're all on the same basket that everybody every single person, So you would think that if we could get together, we'd all be in the same boat. Now, last night we all saw and we witnessed something that I thought was highly inappropriate. In fact, I tweeted Is that all there is? about the president's speech and I wrote something today that I think is very, very salient, very important, and probably not politically correct but I don't care. I don't care. You know, we had a situation in California very recently where somebody was making bombs in an apartment. The mother saw them. The mother didn't notice anything wrong. I watched the sister being interviewed. Believe me, in my opinion, she was lying like crazy. I watched that interview. Oh, my brother was such a wonderful guy. I didn't know, I didn't know, I didn't know. And I watched the next door neighbor saying, Oh, well we didn't report them because we didn't want to racially profile or we didn't want to profile. Give me a break. Give me a break. We're like the stupid country in so many different ways. It's so, can you imagine what our great leaders of the past would have said with the kind of crap that's happening with us? They didn't want to report them because they thought it was profiling. Okay, they saw bombs. They saw, you know, the pipe bombs only this wasn't to build a bathroom. When a bomb is this long, can't put too many of them together for a bathroom, right? And we thought they maybe but we didn't want to racially profile. Oh, okay, you're okay, you're innocent. Or how about where the families and the girlfriends and the wives and everything and they go back to World Trade Center, the worst, worse than Pearl Harbor because with the World Trade Center they were killing innocent civilians. At least while it was a dirty, rotten sneak attack, at least they were, but while it was an attack, at least it was military. But this was an attack on the World Trade Center. So, what's happened is we're out of control. We have no idea who's coming into our country. We have no idea if they love us or if they hate us. We have no idea if they want to bomb us. We have no idea what's going on. And then I looked at poll numbers and I don't mean polls where I'm winning; those numbers I like looking at. These numbers I hated to look at. And it's very, very sad. I'll go after some of the numbers. 25 percent of those polled and this was from the Center for Security Policy, very highly respected group of people who I know actually. This is people living in this country. 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans is justified as Muslims. 25 percent. 51 percent of the Muslims living in this country, by the way, I have friends that are Muslims; they're great people. But they know we have a problem. They know we have a real problem. Because something's going on, and we can't put up with it, folks. We can't put up with it. 51 percent, 51 percent highly respected number of polling groups want to be governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. So I wrote this out. The mainstream media wants to surrender the Constitution. The mainstream media, these people back here. They're the worst. They are so dishonest. No, no, they're so dishonest. They are so dishonest. I mean, I have one from NBC, a reporter from NBC, and actually another one from CBS, they actually in Columbus, Ohio, I had a tremendous crowd like 10,000 people. It was a love fest. It went on for a long time. Everybody stayed right 'tis the end. I had one of the politicians, Kasich, who is just getting, he's a horrible debater, He made a statement that Oh, they left after 10 minutes. Now, the press was there. They saw it. Nobody said it was a lie. It was a total lie. In fact, I had more people at the end than I had at the beginning. Nobody's leaving. Nobody's leaving here except for the one person that was screaming. So, we asked the press to report that it was a total lie and they didn't want to do that because it's not their thing to do. You know, we get the biggest crowds. They don't want to show this crowd tonight. They're not going to show all the people outside trying to get in. They don't do that. They have the cameras right in my face. I say fan the crowd just to show, look at all the people over here. It's a record in the history of this ship. But they don't show it. They don't show it. No, no. And I say fan it and they never ever fan it. I say fan the crowd and they never fan it. And yet, I guarantee you that that young woman that just got taken out after interrupting us three times, I guarantee the cameras will be on her. I guarantee. It's disgusting. Disgusting. , And by the way, some of the media's terrific but most of it 70 percent, 75 percent is absolute dishonest, absolute scum. Remember that. Scum. Scum. They're totally dishonest people. I had one the other day where I finished the speech and they said Oh, Trump was interrupted and he left early. I spoke for like 45, 50 minutes. I then answered questions and then I went around, you know, everybody knew it was false. Amazingly, there's a media group that calls the media and the next day they did the most beautiful story about what a lie it was from NBC. She's back there. Little Katie. She's back there. What a lie it was. No, what a lie, Katie Tur, what a lie it was from NBC to have written that. It was a total lie. And they did a story where they, I didn't know they had a group like this where they actually criticized the media. And they said it was a total lie. And I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. And then other people pick it up. You know it's NBC so somebody picks it up. Third rate reporter. Remember that. Third rate. Third rate. So I said here the mainstream media wants to surrender our Constitution and our constitutional rights. And I don't want that. I want ISIS to surrender. Okay? I want ISIS to surrender. Very simple. It's very simple. So here's what happened. It's been a little controversial. It's been a great day because the poll numbers are through the roof. I like that. But I have more, I wish we could call, is there any way we could call the election tomorrow? Wouldn't you love that? Now they're coming at us in full force. They're coming, not coming at me. They're coming at all of us. They're coming at all of us. Because you know, we have a noisy majority. They used to call it the quiet majority. People are fed up. They're fed up with incompetence. They're fed up with stupid leaders. They're fed up with stupid people. They are fed up with stupid people, where our president makes a deal for Sergeant Bergdahl, a dirty, rotten, no good traitor who, think of it. They knew he was a traitor because a general and a colonel went to see his group. Six people were killed looking for him. Okay? Six people were killed. Young. Unbelievable. I watched the parents on television. I've seen the parents. But I watched the parents on television devastated, will never be the same. They left to try to bring them back. He left. He deserted. You know, in the old days when we were strong country it would be boom, gone. It was called desertion. Now I heard the other day they won't even do anything to him. Can you believe it? They think he's going to get away with nothing. He's going to have nothing. So he left. Oh, they treated him pretty rough though. He got in there, he said, I shouldn't have done this. This isn't working out the way I thought. Anyways, so we get him back and here's the deal we made. We get a dirty, no good traitor. Six people killed, They get five of their greatest killers that they've been after, after, think of it for six years. In fact, I hear nine years. So they get these, right now have gone, they're out in the battlefield, trying to kill everybody in front of them including you folks, I'd hate to tell you. So we get Bergdahl and they get five of the killers that they've wanted for many years. That's the way we do it. The Iran deal. We gave them $150 billion. It's called amateur night. We gave them $150 billion. 24 days, 24 days, we think there's something wrong, 24 days we have to wait but it's much longer than that because there's a whole process before the clock starts ticking. So it could be forever. But the best is where they have the right to self-inspect. Are you doing nuclear weapons over there? Oh, we'll inspect tomorrow. Oh no, we're not doing nuclear weapons. You know, the Persians are great negotiators. Always have been. And somebody would say that's profiling. Trust me, they're great negotiators. And Kerry is a horrible negotiator and Obama is a horrible negotiator. Horrible. He's a horrible negotiator. These people are horrible. I always Obama would be a unifier. I never thought of him as being like a divider because I said You know what? I don't think he's going to be a good president. I backed McCain; he lost by the way. And you know, I don't blame McCain for losing because a lot of bad things will happen; it was a tough one. But I backed McCain; he lost. I backed Romney; he should have won but he sort of went away on vacation or something the last month and he lost. And I said, This time I'm going to do it myself. We're not going to lose. We're not going to lose. We're not losing. And the recent Fox poll that just came out has me beating Hillary very easily one on one. I love that. That's so important. So, we put out a statement today. We watched this. And it's impossible to watch this gross incompetence but I watched last night. And we put out a statement a little while ago and these people are going crazy, Shall I read you the statement? Donald J. Trump is calling for, now, you've got to listen to this because this is pretty heavy stuff and it's common sense and we have to do it. Remember the poll numbers. 25 percent, 51 percent. Remember the poll numbers. So remember this. So listen. Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice. We have no choice. According to Pew Research, among others, there is a great hatred toward Americans by large segments of the Muslim population. Most recently, a poll from Center for Security Policy released data showing 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans, these are people that are here by the way, people that are here, 25 percent not 1 percent. By the way, 1 percent would be unacceptable. 1 percent is unacceptable. 25 percent of those polled agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part, think of that, as part of the global jihad. They want to change your religion. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think so. Not going to happen. As part of the global jihad. And 51 percent of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have the choice of being governed according to Sharia. You know what Sharia is. 51 percent. Sharia authorizes, now look, this is, I mean, it's terrible. Sharia authorizes such atrocities as murders against non-believers who won't convert, beheadings, and more unthinkable acts that pose great harm to Americans especially women. I mean, you look, especially women. Tough stuff. And we have a president that won't even mention the term and you're talking about numbers like this. Mr. Trump stated without looking at the various polling data, it's obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension, Where the hatred comes from and why, we'll have to determine. We'll have to figure it out. We have to figure it out. We can't live like this. It's going to get worse and worse. You're going to have more World Trade Centers. It's going to get worse and worse folks. We could be politically correct and we can be stupid but it's going to get worse and worse. Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victim of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in jihad. These are people only believe in jihad. They don't want our system. They don't want our system and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. They have no respect for human life. So they have no respect for human life. So we have to do something. Now, we can be weak. We can be ineffective. We can be foolish. So prior to Paris, which was a disaster, which by the way if some of the people in those places where it was slaughter, absolute slaughter, had guns, you wouldn't have had the carnage that you had in Paris. You wouldn't had that carnage. If they had guns, you wouldn't had that carnage. So important the Second Amendment. We have to preserve it and cherish it. And we can't let these weak leaders diminish it. If they had guns in Paris, if five people in that room, Paris and France has probably the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world and it was like target practice. Come over here. Boom! Come over here. Boom! People are sitting by the hundreds and many others are going to be dying. They're sitting in the hospital in many cases waiting to die. Now, the same thing a few days ago in California. No guns. We didn't have guns. The bad guys had the guns. And these young people, and I tell the press you've got to stop calling them masterminds, these are dirty, rotten scums. These aren't masterminds. Remember the guy in Paris with the big dirty hat? Remember the guy in Paris, the mastermind. I was watching all the networks. I won't mention who but some of them disgusted me. The mastermind is on the loose. And we have kids that are watching the Internet and they want to be masterminds and then you wonder why do we lose all these kids, they go over there. They're young. They're impressionable. They go over there and they want to join ISIS. And we have our anchors, I think I got them mostly stopped. Did you notice that? I don't hear it too much. But they say the young mastermind. Oh, he's brilliant. Young man, he's brilliant. I don't even he's got a high IQ, In Paris, I call him the guy with the dirty filthy hat. Okay? Not a smart guy. A dummy. Puts people in there, mastermind, bing, bing, bing, it's like shooting everybody. You've got to be a mastermind. So the press has to be responsible. They're not being responsible because we're losing a lot of people because of the Internet. And we have to do something. We have to go see Bill Gates and a lot of different people that really understand what's happening. We have to talk to them. Maybe in certain areas closing that Internet up in some way. Somebody will Oh, freedom of speech, freedom of speech. These are foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people. We have a lot of foolish people. We've got to maybe do something with the Internet because they are recruiting by the thousands. They're leaving our country. And then when they come back, we take them back. Oh, come on back. Where were you? I was fighting for ISIS. Oh, come on back. Go home. Enjoy yourself. When they leave our country and they go to fight for ISIS or any of the other groups, they never come back. They never can come back. They never can come back. They can never, ever, ever come back. It's over. How about that? And now that they've become radicalized, they're totally radicalized. And how about the woman? She was in Pakistan then Saudi Arabia. She comes in on an engagement deal and she radicalized the guy. Probably a guy who couldn't get women. I don't know what the hell his problem is. It's probably the first women he's ever had. I don't know what was going on. But he became radicalized quickly. Notice how easy it is? He becomes radicalized and then they go on a spree. Folks, those days are over. Those days are over. We have to be tough. We have to be smart. We have to be vigilant. Yes, we have to look at mosques and we have to respect mosques. But yes, we have to look at mosques. We have no choice. We have to see what's happening because something is happening in there. Man, there's anger. There's anger. And we have to know about it. We can't be these people that are sitting back like in the World Trade Center, like so many different things. We can't be people that knew what was going on two weeks ago in California, probably for months they knew what was going on and they didn't want to tell anybody. We can't be that. We have to be strong. When we see violations, you have to report those violations and quickly. Don't worry about profiling. I promise I will defend you from profiling. I promise. So when I started this whole quest, I mean, who knew it was going to turn into this? It's been an amazing thing. No matter where I go, I have tremendous crowds, packed crowds, packed. We went to Dallas, 20,000 people in Dallas. 25,000 people. Mobile, Alabama, 35,000 people. Here, every time I come to South Carolina, every time I go to North Carolina, every time I go to Iowa, New Hampshire, Virginia, wherever I go, Florida, we have crowds that are maxed. The only problem we have is the size of the room, thousands of people outside trying to get in. Usually I do a double. I go talk to them for a while, which I wouldn't say I exactly love doing after the first one. But there is an unbelievable love in these rooms, all the same. I love you too. I love you, Thank you. Thank you. I love you too. There's an unbelievable love in all of these places, Oklahoma, 20,000 people standing in a park on quick notice. There's an unbelievable love. And there's an unbelievable love of the country. We want to see good things. We don't want to be bad people. We don't want to be tough and nasty. We believe in the Constitution more than anybody. But we can't let people use and abuse our rights. We can't let people kill us. They want to kill us. They want to destroy us. We can't let it happen. We just can't let it happen. And I have a friend who's a very, very successful man, and I went to one event, he came with me. We had 24,000 people. And this guy's a real tough cookie. He's a great financial guy. One of the guys I'd definitely use to negotiate with Japan, China. Believe me, you're going to be in good shape when that happens. We won't have these characters. You know, this whole thing with all of these guys. By the way, I'm the only one that's self-funding my campaign. Everyone else is controlled. Only one. I'm the only one. Only one. I'm self-funding my campaign. And these other guys. You know, they're getting millions and millions of dollars from people I know. I have one guy came and wanted to give me a lot of money. I said, Honestly, I can't take it. I don't want to do. I can't take it, which is very sort of like for me to not take money, my whole life I've been taking money. Now I'm sort of like what am I doing? But came in and I said, So what are you going to do? I don't want your money. And he said, I got to go someplace else. They're like gamblers. They're like gamblers. But I said, You like me best. I like you best but I'm going to go someplace else. Because they want to be part, they want to, , Let me tell you, who is more than me? I gave millions to these guys. Nobody knows the system better than me. I knew it from the other side. Don't forget, I was the fair-haired boy. I was like the establishment. They'd all come to me, and I'd give them all money I write checks sometimes to Senators whatever the max, bing, bing, bing. I used to say Senators, don't come to my office. Anybody that's a U.S. Senator that calls me, we'll send you a campaign contribution. But you know what? I'll tell you something. In the end, the people that gives these millions of dollars to these horrible, corrupt PACS, they're corrupt, they totally control Bush and Rubio and I won't say Cruz because he's been very nice to me. Nah, he's been nice. He's got to hit me first. Once he hits me, I promise you. I promise you. No, I've been nice to Christie but he really hit me today. Chris Christie. I mean, I don't know. He's a friend of mine but he's not doing well in the polls and he really, really hit me today. He hated this and yet he said anybody could come. You've got to look at some of the statements from the past. But he really hit me on the whole thing that we have to stop the Muslims until we find out what's going on. Does that make sense by the way? Until we find out. And he talked about, that's inexperience and you know in other words he has experience right? But that's the statement of an inexperienced man, About we have to stop people that want to kill us from coming in. Does that sound like inexperienced? So Chris, who's a friend of mine, he hit me hard. And I said I got to hit him at least once. So I won't do this a lot. Look, here's the story. The George Washington Bridge. He knew about it. Hey, how do you have breakfast with people everyday of your lives, they're closing up the largest bridge in the world, the biggest in the United States, traffic flowing during rush hour. People couldn't get across for 6, 7 hours. Ambulances, fire trucks. They're with him all the time, the people that did it. They never said, Hey boss, we're closing up the George Washington Bridge tonight. No, they never said that. They're talking about the weather, right? He knew about it. He knew about it. Totally knew about it. He's a got a very friendly group of people over there that they don't think so. But I don't know. It's called life. You've got to be smart in life. I would say there's less than 1 percent chance. It could be but I doubt it. He knew about it. They didn't mention at one of their meetings? I think they had breakfast like everyday or every other day. They'd just say, Chris, tonight we're closing up the George Washington Bridge because the mayor a certain area is against you. Oh, okay. They didn't mention? Nobody believes that. Number two. Nine downgrades of the state. Nine downgrades. It's a disaster. I have property over there, the taxes are through, I'll use an expression, coming out of my ears, okay? Tremendous taxes over there. You had nine downgrades. You had Christie, you know, so friendly with President Obama during the flood. I actually called. I said, Let me ask you. Is he going to vote for Obama? I thought he was going to vote for Obama. I don't know. I think he possibly did. And Romney I was very disappointed. One of the reasons I was disappointed was he called Christie and had dinner right after the election. If Christie did that to me, I would have never spoken to him again. I would have never done it. So when Chris talks about, when he talks about lack of experience, I built this incredible company. I filed papers where everyone said Wow, that is unbelievable. I would have probably filed them even when I didn't run because I built a great, great company. Tremendous cash. Tremendous assets. Tremendous net worth. Very little debt. Unbelievable cash flow. And I filed. Everybody said Number one, he won't run. And I ran. I took a deep breath and I said, Let's go to my wife and we came down that escalator. Right, the famous escalators. Hopefully in many years that will be a very famous scene because we will have turned around our country and that will be a positive note, okay? But then they said, Oh, well he announced. So these talking heads, most of whom are not even smart people, believe me. Then they'd say well, they went to Ivy League college. So did I go to Ivy League college. They went to this. Most of them didn't go to Ivy League colleges by the way but they say they're brilliant. One's brilliant because he wears glasses, you know? Like Perry. Remember Perry? We don't like him. But what happens is they say Well, he'll never file form A. That's basically where you sign your life away. I filed form A. Then they said, Well, he'll never sign his financial statement because maybe he's not as rich as everybody thinks. Then they said, And if he does, he'll ask for many, many delays because you're entitled to 45 day delays, delays, and you can delay it until forever. And they'll delay it until after the election. I said, No so I filed it ahead of schedule. And what happened? Remember? They went down. They couldn't believe it. It was much, much, much better than anybody ever envisioned. I built a great company and the reason, honestly worth billions and billions of dollars. Remember that, low debt, great cash flow, and the greatest assets, Doral, Trump Tower, the Trump Building, big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco, 1290 Avenue, land all over, land on the Potomac, land all over. In North Carolina, I have a great piece of property. Trump National Golf Club. Some of you know it. Great, right at the best location. And what happens? What happens? So I filed and everyone said Oh, I can't believe it. Then they said Well, maybe he won't do so well with the polls. And you know, before I went, people never believed I was going to run. They never thought I was going to run. And I told the story the other night for really the first real time. But my wife said to me You know if you run you will win. Don't you? She's very smart. I said, What do you mean? She said, If you don't run, you're never going to poll before. Nobody believes you're going to run. So if they do polls like they did these early polls, they weren't great before I announced. She said, No, the only way you're going to get a poll number is you've got to announce. Nobody believes even though they say, even though they say you're running, it doesn't matter. Nobody believes you're running. So I said, All right. I'm getting these lousy early numbers and I'm saying, I don't know. I don't want to run and find out it doesn't work. I don't want to be embarrassed like Lindsey Graham and all these guys who have nothing. It's true. It's true. So I said, All right. Let's take it. So we go down on the escalator. You know what I did? You remember I took a deep breath because I'm telling you and you know what I'm talking about the press down there look like the Academy Awards. There were so many cameras. I have never seen anything like it. The entire atrium of Trump Tower was packed with cameras and press. And I just said, Let's go to my wife. Thank you very much, everybody. You just like me because my daughter happens to be Jewish. Right? She has a great husband, Jared, and I'll tell you what Ivanka could not be happier and she's very proud. The only bad news, I can't get her on Saturday. I call and I call. I can't speak to my daughter anymore on Saturdays. But that's okay. It's an honor to be with you. You know, I've devoted so much time over my life to Israel, and the other politicians they can talk but believe me they haven't done what I've done. I've received many, many awards. I was the Grand Marshal of the Israeli Day Parade at a very dangerous time when people said, "Don't do it. Don't do it." I walked up Fifth Avenue. I'm looking up for lots of trouble. But I said, "No way am I not going to do it." And it was a rough time as you know. It was 2004, and it was a tremendously successful parade. Maybe their most successful parade that they ever had. So, I'm in a different position than the other candidates because I'm the one candidate I don't want any of your money; I want your support but I don't want your money. I'm self-funding my campaign. It's been an amazing experience for me because I have very little money invested so far. I thought by this time I'd have about 30 million in ads and I have none although I took a small radio commercial the other day in Iowa. But we have virtually no money in invested in ads or advertising. And I think you as business people will feel pretty good about this and respect it. At first, I was embarassed by that. I said, "You know, I think we're going to have spend money just to spend money" but it's not really like a good thing to do because I am in first place by a lot. It's not even close. Every single poll, every single state. The numbers just came in three minutes ago in New Hampshire, the PPP poll, Trump at 27%, the next one is 13%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 5%, and the rest are off the board. They have to drop out pretty soon I guess, right? Most of importantly, favorability, no, I still like the top number the most but favorability is now at 50% to 39%, which is good, and I beat Hillary in the Fox poll as you see very easily 46% to 41%. That's ultimately the most important. And you know, I've been a tremendous fan and I've been a tremendous contributor. I've given a lot of money recently to Hatzalah, $100,000, emergency response. They do a fantastic job. And my father, Fred, was always a big supporter. So I grew up in that environment. I grew up in Brooklyn, Queens, and Israel was always very paramount in our mind. In fact, I've been sometimes criticized because I received so many awards from Jewish groups, and they look at my wall. It's loaded up. But now the Christians are catching up, I have to tell you. My Christians are liking me a lot lately and they've been great. They have been great. So, Obama is the worst thing that's ever happened to Israel. The worst. The worst. And when I see great friends of mine who are very, very pro-Israel, very, I mean, they love Israel. They love it with passion, and they're having fundraisers for Obama. I said, "What are you doing?" And it's almost like they answer me and they say, "We don't know. He comes to New York. We don't know. We don't know." I said he's a disaster. I really believe the Iran deal. Look, I'm a negotiator like you folks. We're negotiators. We don't build gas stations in the middle of, as you know, Afghanistan for $43 million, can you imagine this? A small gas station,$43 million, and then they used the wrong kind of terminal because they don't sell that type of gas. Okay? $43 million for a gas station. How many think they could have done it for less? Would you raise your hands please? But I look at Obama, I look at that deal where we gave to Iran $150 billion. They don't need to develop nuclear weapons; they can buy them. They can buy them. It's true. Why do they have to develop them? They can buy them. We gave them $150 billion. They go out and in terms of, you know, surveillance, they have the right to self-inspect. How about that? On their major, most dangerous they can self-inspect. We're going to let them self-inspect. And then you have of course the 24 days and the 24 days we're all good with contracts don't start until such and such happens. It could be forever before you ever go into inspect. And we don't even get our prisoners back. And now they want to start a negotiation to get the prisoners back and they want 19 people for our three. They don't want to give us our four. You know we have four. But they only want to talk three. Now, that should have been negotiated right at the beginning, three years ago. And maybe better than any audience, I mean, the people in this room understand what I'm saying. It should have been you walk in, by the way, did you ever see a negotiation take so long? And we conceded on every single. We didn't win anything. We didn't win anything. But that should have been with our prisoners, day one, whatever it is years ago, we have to get our prisoners back. You don't want them. We need them. It will make us look better. Both everybody is going to like us more. With the American public, any deal that we strike, it's going to look good. And you say that. We have to get our prisoners back. Day one. They're going to say, "No, we're not giving." And we're going to say, "Bye bye. Bye! Call us when you're ready." And then we go out and double up and triple up the sanctions. I guarantee you within 48 hours they're calling, begging us to come back to the table and you have your prisoners back. It's so easy. Now, the president, you saw that, and John Kerry, who is probably the worst negotiator I've ever seen. No, he's the worst negotiator I've ever seen. He did not read The Art of the Deal, folks, I can tell you that. Now, he's one of the few. He's one of the, biggest selling of all time business book of all time, he didn't read it. And Obama definitely didn't read it. Obama, ayeyeye. Oh. But they said, this is hard to believe but this is what they said, a lot of press back there so I have to say everything exactly correct because if I don't I end up with a, they said we didn't want to complicate the negotiations by asking for the prisoners. It's really complicated. We want our prisoners back. Oh, so complicated. They said they didn't want to complicate, so now, we're going to end up making a new deal probably at some point. I'd tell you this, look I'll just tell you this: If I win, before I take office, I guarantee you those prisoners are going to be back. They're going to be back, I guarantee you. They're going to be back. Now, our president doesn't want to use the term, we had another event, which probably was, the one yesterday, probably was related. It always happens but it probably was. When I heard about it, I figured maybe not. But it turns out probably was related, radical Islamic terrorism. And I'll tell you what, we have a president that refuses to use the term. He refuses to say. There's something going on with him that we don't know about. Now, as far as Hillary's concerned, she's going to go with what he wants. She shouldn't be allowed to run. What she did is criminal with the emails. She shouldn't be allowed to run. She's going to have to follow his line because she's on a thread. You know, look, in real life, his Attorney General, his U.S. Attorney, his Attorney General. So his Attorney General is going to listen to him in my opinion. I think it's very dishonest what's going on with our government. General David Petraeus was given a life-changing sentence. Other people have been sent to jail. Petraeus was, you know, essentially, look, I don't want to get into it with the poor guy. What he went, for nothing, compared to what she did for nothing, for 5% of what she did. And Obama, I mean, she can't go against him because only does boom she gets indicted. That's the end of it. That's the end of it. So when you see Hillary backing up virtually everything he says, and he's got control of her. I mean, it's just total control. But I'll tell you what, she shouldn't be allowed to run. What she did was a criminal act. And remember this, this is a six-year, you have a six year statute of limitations. So she's fighting for her life. If she doesn't become president, she could have a real problem. Does that make any sense to anybody? Does that make sense to anybody? Because what she did was just wrong. Okay? And you know she's been involved in corruption her whole life, whether it's Whitewater. I mean, her whole life is corruption. She was a horrible Secretary of State. She did a horrible job other than traveled a lot. She traveled a lot, nothing ever got done. The whole, the world blew up around her. It blew up. 500 to 600 calls and emails and everything from our ambassador asking for help and she didn't respond. The truth is she doesn't have the strength or the energy. She responded to her friends. You know the friends we're talking about. Some of those friends are, you know, sort of an interesting friend going on there. But she responded, yeah, you get that, right? A lot of people don't get that. But she responded to a friend, but she doesn't respond to an ambassador that's asking for help. Hundreds, hundreds of requests and she doesn't respond. Now, remember this, I go every night to someplace. I mean, yesterday I was in Manassas, Virginia, we had an unbelievable crowd. The other day I was in Florida, we had 12,000 people in Sarasota at 12 p.m. with the football games going on. 12,000 people. The convention center held 5,000. So we had thousands outside. I made a speech outside. I made two speechesI said, "You can't get me a larger convention center so I can do one speech?" My people said, "No, this is the biggest one. We set a record, a big record. We set a record everywhere. We beat the record of Elton John. It's true. Elton John. I'm no longer competing with politicians. I'm competing with the musical talent. One of the great musicians said "You get the largest crowds of any single human being on Earth without a guitar" meaning who doesn't count on music. So it's true, we've had tremendous response. We've had incredible response. I think you know if you look at what's going on and I think based on the response, based on the polls, again I don't want your money therefore you're probably not going to support me because stupidly you want to give money. Trump doesn't want money therefore we can't, even though he's better than all these guys, even though he's going to do more for Israel than anybody else, even though Bibi Netanyahu asked me to do a commercial for him and I did and he won his race, so I was very happy about that. But he asked me to do a commercial. And they said I was the only celebrity. I don't know if that's, but they said I'm the only celebrity. I don't know. I'm not a celebrity. See now I'm a politician. I'm so embarrassed by that term. You know, my how life I've been a business, I've been a developer. I've employed tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. I have unbelievable statements and unbelievable company. A lot of people said, "Oh, he'll never file." This you'll get a kick out of. "He'll never run because he'll never want to file various papers. And then he'll never file this and that and then you'd have to sign your life away." The first paper, we all know about first papers. You sign your life away. That's the end of it. He did it. Then they said, "Well, he'll never sign and he'll never file his financials because who knows, maybe he's not as rich as people think." So I filed my financials, almost 100 pages. The biggest ever filed by the federal elections. And everybody said, "Oh my, it's much bigger and much stronger and holy mackeral, look at these numbers!" If I didn't run, I'd probably would have filed anyways because you know I built a great company and I like to brag about it whenever possible. It's true. Some of the greatest assets, Doral, you know, Doral and Turnberry in Scotland and Trump Tower and many buildings in Manhattan. Just many, Bank of America building in San Francisco with a great partner and so many other buildings and things And the reason I bring that up is because that's the kind of thinking we need. And I don't bring it up as braggadocio. I bring it up because that's the kind of thinking we need in this country to bring us back. We have people that don't know the first thing about the word negotiation. I can take anybody in this office, believe me, and they're better than Obama and they're better than Kerry and they're better than the foolish people, the foolish people. It's so embarrassing when you see what happens. Sergeant Bergdahl, all right? Sergeant Bergdahl, we get a traitor; they get five of the greatest killers that they've wanted for nine years. You know, the deal was five for one. And they knew he was a traitor before we made the deal. You know about Sergeant Bergdahl. He deserted. Six people were killed trying to get him back. They were looking for him. The general and the colonel went to see all those people, they said, "No, he deserted. He was a traitor." And we still made the deal. So we get a traitor. We can give him back. Do you want to re-negotiate deals? Some of us will re-negotiate deals. I would say about 99.9,is there anybody that doesn't re-negotiate deals in this room? This room negotiates so I want to re-negotiate, perhaps more than any room than I've ever spoken. Maybe more. It's okay. I've been called on that a couple of times too. But the fact is I want to renegotiate that deal. I want to drop him right smack in the middle of where he came from. The hell, they can have him even if we don't get the five guys back because that's not going to happen because you know where they are right now? They're right now all in the battlefield fighting us and trying to kill us and kill anybody that gets in. So they get their five guys that they've wanted for nine years they've wanted them and we get a dirty rotten traitor. But that's the way our people negotiate. They're stupid people. Okay? They're stupid people. It's very sad. It's very sad. So I'll just tell you that I'm going to win. I am. I'm going to win. I mean, unless something happens, you know, walk across the street, the wrong thing happens. But I'll tell you what, I have a great secret service. Here's a nice one, you're number one, they give you a secret service. I never saw so many people, talented people, great people. But I believe I'm going to win. I really have just a great feeling about it. And you know, my life has been about winning. I've won, and my life has been about winning, and that's what I want to do for the country. And if people say about my company and deals and you can do this deal or that deal, I have no interest. It's like the other day, Ivanka, she's doing so great. "Dad, we can buy this wonderful office building and I said, "Honey, who cares? How can you talk to me about such trivial things, Ivanka?" It's amazing. See? Now I'm dealing in trillions. I've never heard of trillions before. You know, with this, we owe $19 trillion. We just signed a budget that's so bad and the Republicans, you know, we know where the Democrats are coming from. But these Republican politicians, they go to Washington and they're going to end Obamacare, which I'm going to do by the way, I'm ending, I'm terminating, it's going to be repealed and replaced with something much better. But they go to Washington and they're going to do this and they're going to do budgets, like I heard the guy before "We're going to work in the budget." It's all about that. What happens is they're going to do budgets like we're going to do this and that and I tell this story, then they walk into the Capitol Building, which is magnificent, and they look up "Darling, oh my, look at those columns, look at the ceiling, look at the angels. Oh, look at these magnificent floors." They've never seen anything like it. "We've arrived. This is incredible." And then they become mainstream. "We'll vote on Obamacare. Yes, I vote." They don't want to leave. They lose all of their courage. I want to use a nice word because otherwise they'd get reported for foul language. They lose all of their courage and they've let us down. That won't happen with me. So, again, you're not going to support me even though you know I'm the best thing that could ever happen to Israel and I'll be that. I know why you're not going to support me and you know you're not going to support me because I don't want your money. Isn't it crazy? No, it's true. You know, if I wanted to have your money, I think I'd have a damn good chance and I think I'd get more money than anybody else. Do you know the money I have turned down? This has not been my life turning down money. Guys want to give me millions. I would have made, poor Jeb Bush, I mean, this poor guy with his low energy. It's sad. No, it's sad. I came up with that term, it became so defining. It's like having it on his forehead "I am low energy". No, no, it's sad. He raised $125 million, which means he's controlled totally, totally controlled by the people that gave him the money. That's why you don't want to give me money, okay? But that's okay. You want to control your own politician. That's fine. Good. Fine. Think about that, folks. Don't worry about it. I understand. Hey, five months ago, I was with you. Who's better than me? Who is better than me? I gave $350,000 to the Republican Governors Association. I never even gotten a letter of thank you. It's true. $350,000. I didn't receive one letter, not one letter from one governor. Stupid. The good thing is I don't give any, why would I give any more? You don't get a thank you letter. Politicians, remember this, politicians forget, politicians generally aren't competent, and the one thing they are good at is getting elected and that's what you're going to end up having. But I would love your support but I don't want your money. I appreciate it. Now, let's take some questions. Okay? Good. I was telling some of the folks backstage, I never ever thought we'd do this well this fast. This has been so incredible. What's happened all over. What's happened in Iowa. It's been really incredible. We've had some amazing results and they continue to come in. Got a little shake-up in Iowa. I don't know what's going on. Somebody said "Are you going straight to New Hampshire?" Now, I love New Hampshire. We've got great numbers. 38 to 12. That's good. But we fell a little behind in Iowa, and some people are saying how can it be. And I come out and I was just telling a group we have the biggest crowds, we have the most enthusiastic crowds. Everybody said and it's very true. I mean, look at this. Somebody else would come, they'd have like 50 people and they wouldn't need this room. Believe me. But everybody said without question in every poll, this isn't just here, that the people that are with Trump are with Trump. They don't go anywhere. They're staying. It's true. I see it. I see it. And we've seen it. You know, a couple of times I say "Well, that could be the end." Then they do something and I'm 10 points up. It's the craziest thing, right? But we'll take it. But they say the people are with, we have the most loyal people by far. Everybody says it. The other thing they say is for leadership, number one. Very important, right? Don't you think? Leadership. I mean, when leadership is number one, they say on the economy without question number one and by a lot. So you know it's great. I thought I'd talk a little bit and I want to take some questions. You know, we can do a little question and answer. Right? We have all these cameras going back here. And you know, it's always tough when you're on live television all the time. Look, we have 10 topics. Right? How many topics? 10? How many different ways can you talk about the 10 topics? The bottom line is we want results. We want to get it done. But when you're on live television all the time all those people back there and the cameras are on and then you're talking about immigration and you're talking about the wall because we're going to have a wall and we're going to stop illegal immigration. But we talk about trade and we talk about repealing Obamacare. And we talk about all the things that we talk about. But you know, you have these points and we could talk about them in different forms, in different ways and give different examples. But in the end, it's really about results. Isn't it? It's really about results. And you can only talk about the same subjects on live television so many different ways. I talk about industry. I talk about commerce. I talk about how we're losing our jobs to all of these different countries. And I give different examples. But it's still going to be a certain number of subjects. I talk about Second Amendment. I talk about Fourteenth Amendment. We talk about amendments. You know, that Second Amendment, they want to take it away from you. They really want to do things and it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. At least with me it's not going to happen. That I can tell you. So I said today you know we'll talk for a little while but I want to do some questions and answers. I want you people to excite me for a change. Is that okay? I want to be excited. And so we're going to have some fun. We're going to do that. A few things, I want to bring up a few new subjects. So, immigration, we're going to be doing a very strong number. It's killing us. It's killing us. And it's bad for the economy. It's bad for, all of this illegal immigration. And I have to tell you legal, you come in and we're going to have a good time and you're going to be there and you're going to do great, and visas, maybe work, maybe there are cases where you need people in and we'll do something, we're not going to hurt our economy in any way, shape or form. We're going to make our economy much, much stronger. But we're also going to get jobs for people that are here. People with us. We're going to get jobs. We're going to get jobs. But the illegal immigration, you know, I did this and I made my determination, I took a deep breath. Because I'll tell you what, it takes courage to say I'm going to run for president. It really does, especially in my case where I have a great business and I love my business. I love doing it. I may never even see it. I mean, I own some of the great properties in the world. Doral in Miami. I may never see it again Turnberry in Scotland, one of the greatest homes of the British Open and all of that. I may never see it again. All of these incredible places that I have. But more than that, it takes courage because when you do it, you're putting yourself out there beyond anything that anybody's done and it even takes courage for a politician to do it. Now at some point some of these guys have to leave. Don't we agree? It's getting ridiculous. Because like tomorrow night we're having a debate, and I wish we had more time for the debate. Not in terms of three hours because who wants three hours? You know, I could stand up for 20 hours if I had to but who wants to watch that long? Hillary's debate essentially lasted for an hour and a half and I was, oh, it was, you couldn't watch it. You have Hillary against a socialist/communist. And honestly, he's not going to win. Just so you understandHe's not going to win and neither is she Well, she's being totally protected because in theory she shouldn't even be allowed to run. She's being protected. It's a tough game and it's a nasty game but she's being totally protected. But she's going to beat him and you still have one more of these guys. O'Malley. So he'll be out quickly, I guess. I don't know what's he doing. What do they do when they have zero? They have zero. And I wouldn't say it against our folks. But they've treated me, some of the zeroes have treated me so nastily, right? Because they want to start controversy and they want to try pick up some points. And you know what? I'm not going to even mention names. Usually I do. I love doing it. But everybody that's hit me so far has gone down. They've gone down. And they've gone down bigly. And a couple of the ones and zeroes, they're the ones that hit the hardest. I mean, they're like desperate people. But they hit. One of them has a zero with an arrow pointing to the left. That means less than zero. And I don't understand. What does it mean? I assume it's a typo but maybe not. But when you look at the things that are happening with our country, the trade situation with not just China, I talk about China all the time because that's the main abuser, that's the biggest abuser. The numbers are astronomical. Almost $400 billion a year in terms of imbalance. Think of it,$400 billion a year. And they send stuff over here but we can't send stuff over there. They tax us. Big tax. A friend of mine can't get stuff over there. The tax is so big. Big tax. Somebody bought an airplane in China here. Can't get it over there. Spoiled guy. Rich guy. Bought a beautiful plane. Can't get it over there because the tax is so massive that he's now selling in this country because China won't let him have the plane and he has to pay a tax. I won't even tell you what the tax is. It's so astronomical that I don't even believe them myself. So I'm not going to say it because those guys will say "Well, he was wrong." All I can tell you is it's a massive tax. Like you don't buy planes here because if you do, you won't be able to get them back in. And here, we accept all of their products. So we have almost a $400 billion trade imbalance with China. We have a $70 billion trade imbalance with Japan. We have a, you know, with all that's going on in the South China Sea and you look where we have a destroyer, a relatively small ship, over there, I don't know if I'd want to be the captain of that ship right now. But they're being sort of mocked and scorned and a lot of bad things can happen. But you know, we have an agreement with Japan and I love Japan. I love China. I love all these people. But their leaders are killing us because they're smarter, sharper, more cunning. The leaders of Mexico are killing us at the border and in trade. They're taking so many of our companies. Even Nabisco, my Oreos, they're taking Nabisco. Right? I'm never eating Oreos. I tell it all the time. They had some Oreos before on the plane and I said I don't want to touch them. Bring them back. I yelled out to bring them back. But I'm not happy. They're leaving Chicago and they're moving their big plant to Mexico. So when you see this happening, we have to stop it. And I'm not going to beat around the bush and "Oh, let's talk and let's be nice and let's say," Nobody can do it like I do it. Nobody. Honestly, nobody. We can, I'm not saying I'm perfect because I'm not perfect. Nobody's perfect Now, nobody's perfect. But I'll tell you when it comes to that stuff I'm really, there's nobody better. Carl Icahn endorsed me the other day. He's one of the great traders, one of the great dealmakers. He says Trump, Trump. And he's not somebody that just do it. He wants somebody that knows what they're doing. He understand. You talk about corporate inversions and all of the things that have been going on. Corporate inversions. You know, many of the companies in this country have trillions of dollars cumulatively. They think $2.5 trillion overseas right now. They can't get it in. And everybody agrees that we should bring it in. The Democrats and the Republicans. They've agreed for years. They can't make a deal because they have no leader. It's not like "Oh gee, we disagree on Obamacare. Or we disagree on something else." Although I must tell you many of the Democrats that I speak to because I'm friendly with all of them. I'm friendly with like Republicans. I get a long with everybody. You know, everybody says "Oh, you won't be a unifier". I'll be the greatest unifier of all. Why is Obama a unifier? But I will tell you many of the Democrats who voted for Obamacare would never have done it now and were lied to 28 times. Right? "You can keep your doctor, keep your plan, keep your this, everything's going to be great." Turned out to be a total lie. 28 different times that they know of and they wouldn't have done it. But when you look at what's happening with corporations and the highest tax, we pay the highest tax anywhere in the world of any country, but they have trillions of dollars overseas. And these are great companies in many cases. They have thousands of employees. They can't get their money back. And the reason is bureaucracy. It's very hard. And also big reason the tax is too high. They don't want to bring $1 million back and pay $300,000 or $350,000 tax. They'd rather leave it over there. And if they bring it back, they'll be using it to invest in our country. I mean, a lot of good things will happen. I happen to believe it's more than $2.5 trillion. But here's the thing and I use it because it's so incredible. Here's the thing. It's not controversial. It's not like you have the Republicans here and you have, everybody agrees. They've agreed you know that for 2.5, 3 years. They can't make a deal. And now what's happening and this will be the next great story is companies are leaving the United States, two reasons, lower taxes but also to get their money. They've got billions of dollars overseas. They're leaving our country in order to get their money and in order to pay lower tax. And you're talking about one company I know of, I don't know how much they've written about it, but you're talking about 6,000 jobs just one company. You're talking about potentially thousands of companies. And I say it, in the old days, they'd leave New York. People would move down and companies would move down to Florida or they'd move to Texas or they'd leave New Jersey, where taxes are quite high, and they'd move to another location. Right? Now, they leave our country and they go to other countries. That's what's happened. In the world of the Internet and the world of very fast jets, it's a different world out there. And there's no loyalty. They're paid a lot of money to make a lot of money for their shareholders and some of them are actually foreign; they'd like to move back to these countries. They bring in executives that are from Ireland, from other places. And they don't mind. They don't have loyalty to the United States. So my plan, my tax plan, is something I'm very proud of. We're going to solve corporate inversion. I'll tell you what, we will have that money back, if I get elected president, that money will be back so fast your head will spin. Nobody else will be able to do it. Nobody. Honestly, nobody else even knows about it. The other candidates, most of them don't even know about it. It's not their wheelhouse. Okay? It's not their thing. It's not their thing. Their thing is getting re-elected. That's what they're good at. They get re-elected. And they make promises and they're all talk and they're no action. And the same things happen with these politicians. It's always the same. So we have so many different things and what I've done with our tax plan, which something I'm very proud of, we've brought it down to a few groups. Because right now, you have to go out, people who aren't doing well go out and hire companies to help them with their tax plans. They'll pay $500, $1,000 because it's so complicated. And we're going to make it nice and simple. And we're getting rid of carried interest, which is something that a lot of rich hedge fund guys love. But we're getting rid of it. They don't love me so much anymore. But I don't care. And we're getting rid of a lot of things. So we're going to have a nice simple tax return. Somebody said "Oh, why isn't everybody paying?" You know, 40%,a big percentage, will not pay any tax at all. People that are doing badly. They said, well, I won't use the candidates' name because I don't want to insult any candidate when they can't defend themselves. They said "We want everybody to pay at least something." And I said, "I agree." Here's the problem. From the standpoint of bookkeeping, from the standpoint of bureaucracy, you're talking about millions and millions of returns. You're talking about building the IRS even bigger and it's a monster. And I could cut it down way down. And the money that you're talking about is far less than the administrative costs. So I said, "I agree. Except for one thing from a practical standpoint, it's too much. Most of these people aren't paying anyway." What I want to do is bring our jobs back from China, bring our jobs back from Mexico, bring fairness to our deals as an example with Japan. I was in Los Angeles. Ships, the biggest ships you've ever seen. Cars are pouring off into this country. Made in Japan. We give them practically nothing. The balance is so bad. The imbalance is so bad. And then we have all the strikes. See, what our people don't know and only somebody that wrote "The Art of the Deal" or does this stuff. It's natural. It's like a great athlete. Like a Jack Nicklaus. He was always able to sink that putt. Right? You know, he's just better. And you have athletes, very few, but there are some people that have a certain ability. A lot of people don't even know we have all the power. We have all the power in China. You know, we owe right now China and Japan equally $1.5,think of this, trillion. $1.5 trillion. Think of this. They take our business and in the case of Japan, mostly cars. But they take our business. They take our jobs. Factories close down all over the place. And we owe them money. Right? It's a magic act. For them not for us. For us it's a horror show. It's going to end. It's going to end. And people like Carl Icahn and the people like the best negotiators, I know the best negotiators in the world. Some I think are horrible people. I'll be honest with you. I don't care. Do you care if they're horrible people? Who cares? Now, Carl happens to be actually a very nice guy but he's a brilliant negotiator and a tough cookie and he's built a fortune. He doesn't want money. He doesn't want to say, "Oh, give me $200,000 a year in government money." He wants to do it. He's proud to do it. He wants to help the country. And it's so easy for him. For instance, if I say "Carl, do me a favor. The trade deal we have with China is so unfair we're losing $400 billion a year. Carl, do me a favor. Make it fair." I don't have to give him a big speech. I don't have to give him a big speech. I mean, I can tell you that within a very, very short period of time, things will straighten out. I mean, things will straighten out and it's going to be our benefit. But think of it, if we're losing that kind of money, that imbalance. It's an imbalance. Some people will say "That's not really a loss." It is a loss. If we have that kind of imbalance and suppose you brought it back to zero or even if we lost $100 billion a year, that's a lot of money. Believe me, I couldn't sleep. If I brought it to $100 billion a year, get rid of me in four years, all right? But suppose we brought it back to $100 billion or we brought it back to zero, do you know what that means to this country? Do you know the kind of money you're talking about? Then jobs will start coming back, lots of good things would happen. Lots of great things would happen. And maybe our babies who have all these toys all over the place, maybe they'll have 75% and maybe they'll like them better. Maybe they'll be better. And they'll be manufactured here. Whenever I order television sets, I ordered thousands and thousands of television sets a year for different jobs. And whenever I order them, they all come from South Korea. They make all the television, other than Sony but Sony has sort of lost its way a little bit. Sony is Japan. But South Korea, LG, Samsung. I don't get bids from American. I'd love to. I'd love to. George Will said there's a company in South Carolina that makes television. I said where are they? I'd like to have a good name too by the way. It's important. You know, when somebody's paying you a fortune for a hotel room, it's nice to see a good name. Right? Do we agree? Well, it's a company in South Carolina but they don't make them there; they assemble them. They'll order parts that come in and they'll assemble them. But much different. But I'd love it if we made them. But you take South Korea. We defend South Korea for essentially nothing. You have the maniac over in North Korea that nobody ever talks about by the way. Now, he really has nuclear weapons and we don't talk about him. We made the worst deal ever made with Iran. Right? The worst. These are the people that represent, these people are incompetent. Or stupid. Somebody said, "You shouldn't say stupid. It's not nice." But it's true. They're stupid. I think. I mean, I think. Unless I don't know is there something going on that we don't know about? Think of it. Point after point, we lost. We lost everything. We've given them $150 billion. Hard to believe. They don't have to develop, I was telling somebody they don't have to develop nuclear weapon; they can buy it. What the hell why should they develop it? They can buy it. And now all of a sudden they're going into Syria. They got so much money. They're a terrorist state. They're going into all of these different places. We're fighting them in Yemen and yet we're making a deal with them. So why don't you say "Hey, Yemen out"? Our prisoners, I want them back. I want them back. I don't want them over there. I want them back. And all we have to do, very simple, is if you have the right messenger. I'm the right messenger. You know, I've gotten to a point where I have to be braggadocious. It's terrible. Right? Because I can't be so nice and say "We can all do a wonderful job". People can't do those kind of stuff. For instance, the wall. I said, I guarantee you that we're going to build a wall. It's going to be a real wall. We're going to have people come through and they're going to come through legally. Or they're going to come through with visas, which is a safe way, if we need it. And we want people to come through. I want people to come through. I don't want to say no. But we have at least 11 million, you know, the scary thing is nobody has any idea how many. You know, we've been hearing that number for years. You know, like 11 million. We have no idea. I spoke to one of the top people. They have no idea. Might be 5 million. Might also be 32 million. Could be $50 million But we have to get them out. We have to, look, it's harsh. Dwight Eisenhower, we all like Dwight. Right? Remember the expression. Right? I go remember he got elected,"I like Ike". How could he be bad? All right? And I think he was a nicer general than MacArthur and Patton. And I like Ike as a president but I love Patton and I love General MacArthur. I love them. And we're going to find ourselves a Patton and we're going to find ourselves because we have a lot of smart guys in our military and women. We're going to find ourselves a PattonBut we're going to find a Patton and we're going to find a MacArthur. And I'm really good at that. We're going to find great people. And I've told this story where I watched these generals go on television, they shouldn't be on television. They shouldn't be talking. You know? They shouldn't be talking. They should be doing. And they asked a certain general, I'm not going to insult him. It was like a month and a half ago. On a show. A talk show. I said here's general so and so, one of the top, top, top people. I said what's he doing on television? And he's saying "Well, ISIS is very tough. You know, they spread out." By the way, they took the oil that I said take. Remember I said "Take the oil"? Always take the oil! They're being funded by the oil that I said take. I don't want their damned oil. But you know what? It turned out to be another benefit of having it. Take the oil. And we didn't do it. We shouldn't have been in Iraq in the first place. And I said that in 2003. Shouldn't have been there. We totally destabilized the Middle East. We totally blew it. But we were there. Then Obama announces because he's so predictable "We are leaving on a certain date in a year." Right? I couldn't believe. I was sitting there thinking "Did he really say that?" He said "We will have all troops out by a certain date." Right? Did he say that? I said "No, no, tell me please." Oh, you know what another one I got high marks on from every poll? Military. They think I'll be the best in the military because they say I, you know, I always say I'll be the greatest jobs president that God ever created. I will. But everybody knows that, especially God. Everybody knows that. But you know what I'll be? I'll be the great at the military. I'll be so good. And I'll know when, and I'll build our military so strong, so tough, so incredible, nobody's going to mess around. We're never going to have to use it. We're never going to have to use it. And I'm going to take care of our vets. Believe me, they're our greatest people and our vets are not being treated as well as illegal immigrants. I'm going to take care of our vets. So go back. So the world is unpredictable. I made a business deal a year ago. And the guy, oh, I beat him so badly. Aye, it was so beautiful. It was a beautiful thing. It was like a picture. For me, it was like a picture. That's my own problem. I guess. But to me it's like a painting when you could do something like that. So I made this deal and it was great. And they called. They did a story on me recently and it was a nice story. And I said, I hope they don't call this guy. They ended up calling this guy "What do you think about Trump?" And he said but in a respectful way, he said "He won because he was so damn unpredictable. We don't know what the hell he was going to do." That's a positive. That's a positive. I mean, if you're a poker player and you're predictable, you're not going home with much money. Okay? But it was really, I said, "That's not nice what he said." First, I said "That's not nice. I'm unpredictable." Then I said, "Wait a minute. He meant that as a compliment." And I called him. I said, "What did you mean by that?" He said "I think that's the greatest compliment I can pay. We could not figure you out. You came at us from 15 different angles." So with Obama, when he announces that we're leaving Iraq on a certain date, we shouldn't have been there but once you announced the bad guys, you know how they say the surge worked? You know why the surge worked? You know why? Because the bad guys all moved back. They said, "Hey, what do we have to get killed for?" I mean, these people don't mind being killed, can you believe it? But they said "If we don't have to, let's not." So they moved back. And they said, "Hey, they're leaving in -" What was the date? Do you remember the date? Specific date to the day. "We will have all troops out. I'm a great president." So the bad guys, meaning the opponents, whatever you want to call them, they just said, "Oh, you're leaving in a year. Going to have all the troops out. Let's go back. Why do we have to be shot at for the next year? And what do we have to do because if we do well maybe he'll change his mind and stay. So let's let him think he has this great victory with the surge." Right? "The surge worked!" What happened was that everybody pulled back. They said, "Let's wait." Now we leave because of a lack of leadership. We leave and boom it comes apart. That's what happened. That was the surge. Everybody talk so much,"Oh, the surge was so great." The surge was great because everybody knew, they knew what was happening. They knew it was going to happen. They knew we were leaving even through Bush. I mean, honestly, they knew we were leaving. They were fed up. So they pulled back and they said, "Let's get them out." Everybody wanted to leave. Now, I would have done it differently. Even if I wanted to leave and I might or I might not. I won't even say. People say, "Mr. Trump, what's your attitude on ISIS? When will you attack them? Where? I say "You know, I don't want to talk, I have a real chance of winning. I don't want to tell you what my attitude. I want them to guess. I don't really want to tell you." I mean, the one bad thing about our system, we have a system that got flaws. Let's face it. Hey, look at our leadership, it's got flaws. But you know the one bad thing? When I gave that answer, they say, although some people, I see it here, some people say "We love that. We love that." But when I give that answer, some people say "Oh, Trump doesn't know. He doesn't know. He didn't give an answer as to exactly what he's going to do. Exactly what he's going to do." And I know exactly what I'm going to do and eventually after I was asked the question by 10 different reporters, all of whom are here tonight by the way, I said, "You know, here's the problem. If I don't give the answer, I'm not going to win because they write so incredibly negatively. So if I don't give the answer, I'm not going to win." They're going to say "Trump wouldn't give us the answer." They don't know it's unpredictability. They don't know it's strategy. And I said for a period of time like a month, I said "I don't want to tell you because I actually have a chance because from the time I announced, I've been on the top of the polls, almost at the top. You know, we're doing well." Iowa, will you get your numbers up please? Would you get these numbers up? I promise you I would do such a good job. First of all, I am a great Christian and I am. I am. Remember that. And I do well with the evangelicals. But the evangelicals left me down a little bit just last month. I don't know what I did. But I am a great Christian. I'm a believer and I believe in the Bible. And I even brought my Bible a month ago to a group signed by my mother, Mary, and with the address and the date, I won't tell you what date it was because possibly you'd think I'm younger than that. But she didn't want anybody taking my Bible because that was very important to her. So cute. She has the address, has the date. But I said to myself, "You know," By the way, before I forget, will you get the numbers up Iowa please? This is ridiculous. I mean, what is my competition? In all fairness, in all fairness, what is my competition? Do you think these guys, I'm not going to say Carson, I'm not going to say Rubio, who really is way down, I mean, I am second. It's not like it's terrible. But I don't like being second. Second is terrible to me. But do you think that Ben is going to go to China? These guys are fierce. Like they'd come into your office. I've made many deals with China. I've had great victories in terms of deals with China. They come into your office. There's no "Hello. How are you? It's a wonderful day." They come in,"We want deal." There's no games. I do this for a living. I'm really good at it, folks. Really good. And you know, when you talk about energy, I'll tell you one thing, everybody agrees, oh, do I have energy. Oh. I toss and turn thinking about how I'm going to make the best deal for you folks. I'll be tossing and turning. I will be tossing and turning. You're going to have so many deals that is so good for you. We're going to have numbers are going to be so good. I always joke you may get tired of them but then I always take that back because nobody gets tired of winning. We don't win anymore. You know, think about it. Do we win at all? Ever? We lose with the military. ISIS beats us. Everybody. We lose with trade. When are we going to come back and say, "We beat China" on a deal? When are we going to come back, "We beat Japan"? Do you know that everybody said "Oh, Japan. They have so power over us. They have so much power because we owe them $1.5 trillion and they send all those cars." They have no power. If we ever say, "Listen, if you're not going to treat us fairly, we don't want your cars anymore", they'd go out of business, folks, they're gone. Same thing with China. China is not even doing that well. But they just lowered, they just devalued their currency. The biggest in two decades. And the reason they did it, they could never thought but we have so many other problems that they felt, "Oh wow, we can get away with this and it's going to make it impossible." Did you see the results yesterday of Caterpillar Tractor? Horrible. Because they're not getting stuff out because everybody, Japan and China in particular, is devaluing their currency. That's their number one weapon. And the stupid trade deal that we're making doesn't even cover it. That's their number one weapon and the trade that we're making doesn't cover it. So I only say this and you know what? People might say "It's terrible. He's a terrible person, a terrible human being. But I'm going to vote for him anyways." Okay, that's fine. I'm actually a nice person. I always say this, nobody can do this stuff better than me. And I know all the guys I'm running against. They're wonderful people. Some of them I really like. But who cares? I was talking to one of the candidates the other day. I was talking about corporate inversions and they didn't even know what the hell I was talking. They had no idea. It's not their thing. And unless we stop all of the things that are going with other countries and unless we make great trade deals, we're being eaten alive. That's why when you look at the phony numbers, we have 100 million people in our workforce that aren't working. Our real unemployment rate is probably 30%. It's not 5.3%. That was done for politicians so they'd look good. It's not 5.3%. How can you have 5.3% when you have 100 million people? You look for a job. If you're a young guy, that handsome young guy with the red hair, right therebut if he comes out and he goes into the workforce and he looks for a job and he goes through college and does well and then he can't get a job and when he gives up because at some point after months you give up, they essentially consider you employed. It's the most ridiculous thing. We have a tremendous, tens of millions of people in that position. They can't find jobs. They're good people. They want to work. They can't. But it's not reflected in the real numbers because the politicians want to look good. So let me just before we talk some questions, I'm going to talk about something I've never really talked about it onstage but we should talk about it. It's called Super PACs. It's one of the great scams of all time. It's one of the great scams. So we sent out, I think I had, and it's not me. People set them up. And I don't know. Maybe they're setting up for my benefit. Let's take me. A guy sees me, likes me, sets up a Super PAC. I don't talk to him. I don't do anything. I think we had either 9 or 5 or 11. We don't even know. They're all over the place. Trump, Trump, one of them called The Art of the Deal PAC after the book. They have all these PACs. And the money comes in. And what do they do with the money? I don't know. And we aren't supposed to call them or anything. Okay. So, we wrote a letter, a legal letter, to I think either 9 or 11 last week saying we don't want their money, send it back because again, what do they do with it? If some guy that's having a hard time all of a sudden has $2 million sitting in a Super PAC, do you think he's going to take ads for Trump? Maybe and maybe not. So we sent them a, it's a scam, Super PACs, a scam. It's a disgrace that we have. A disgrace. And I'll tell you I read a number with, as an example, with Ben. Ben is paying 70 to almost 80 cents on the dollar to raise money. So when you read he has all this money, he's paying a lot of money and that's not reflected yet. So when you hear they raised $20 million, they're paying, now think of it, who pays, the number I actually heard was 79 but you know these guys will check them so I'm telling you it may be off but you all know it's a lot. I think they said, 79 cents on the dollar. Think of it. To raise the money, they take 79 cents before they get to use the money for what it was supposed to be. Somebody is making a fortune. I know in Romney's campaign, a couple of guys walked away with millions and millions of dollars. Millions. They became rich raising money. It's better than being a real estate broker. For the people and real estate brokers, they take these massive percentages of the money they raise. It's a scam. It's a scam. Now, in Ben's case, his Super PAC is running Iowa. And let me tell you, the people that are running that Super PAC, even if it comes in small donations, those are the real bosses. Those are the bosses. In the case of Jeb Bush, you're not supposed to deal with these Super PACs. Okay? So, it was in the Wall Street Journal the other day. He has a Super PAC fundraiser or something in a hotel and right next to it, he had his campaign ballroom. Did you read that? Two ballrooms. One here, one here, right next to each other by coincidence, of course. They're not supposed to be coordination. They're not supposed to be talking. They're right next to each other. And that's nothing compared to what some are doing. It's a scam and it should be stopped. And it's unfair to somebody like me that is spending my own money. And what happened and I haven't talked about this before but I'm seeing what's going on. It's horrible what's going on. What happened is the last time they had the Super PACs, I actually think there was sort of a wall. You know, they called it the wall. And this is a wall too. Won't be as good as the one I'm going to build but it's a wall. But it was a wall and they didn't deal. I mean, even though like Bush has a friend of his running his Super PAC, I'm sure they never talk. I'm sure. What do you think the chances are that they talk? 100% or 99%? 100%. I'd say 100%. I'd say 100%. Only a foolish person would say 99%. But whatever. They're not supposed to. But they put a friend in there. They put other people in there. They put whoever. And that's the way it works. And in some cases, I hear in Ben's case, I hear in other cases, they're literally running. I mean, had Walker done this in all fairness because he had money in the Super PAC but he had no money in his campaign and he was unable to figure out this is what they're all doing. That's why he's out of the race because he couldn't figure it out. The whole thing with Super PACs is a horrible, horrible scam. So I sent letters last week to as many as we could find. They're all over the place. We want you to close the Super PAC. We want nothing to do with it. We don't want to get advertisements. We don't want any of the money. Go home and ideally give the money back. They don't even have to give the money back from what I understand. They can keep it. They'll probably if they actually raised money for me, they'll say "What a horrible thing he just said. I think we're going to support somebody else." They could do that. But the Super PACs have total control over the people running for office. Total. Nothing over me. Nothing. I feel it's very unfair. I feel it's a very unfair situation. Now, if they want, they could have full disclosure and everythingBut what are they doing with this whole thing? And I think it makes dishonest people out of people that might be honest. But the Super PACs are controlling your candidates, some more than others. Some are unbelievable. And what the press should really do is take a look at how much money is left. When you read that Ben raised $1, how much is left after he pays all of the consultants and all of these people, how much is left to spend in the campaign. You'll be amazed. I mean, it's so little. Bush, it's the same thing. And I'll go over, there are other names. I know every one of them. But it's a horrible thing that's taking place. And again, last cycle, at least they went through the motions. Now, they're not even going through the motions. They're not even going through. And just remember when I have to negotiate with companies to keep them in this country so they build jobs here and they build their plants here and their factories here and they do all of the things here, when I have to do that, you know, John Deere, I paid them tens of millions of dollars. You can even check. I said to John Deere, "I want an endorsement." I don't know if they'll give me an endorsement. I'll tell you if they don't they're not so smart. I guarantee no other person gave John Deere, I mean, I bought probably more than $10 million worth of John Deere equipments. I love it. You know why? Iowa. Iowa. I love it. I love it. When we can. By the way, it's a great company. It's a great company. But I buy a lot of stuff from John Deere because I have a lot of big developments that really require John Deere type equipment. I don't have to buy it from them. I could buy it from others. But I want to steer it to them when I can. But we have to do something to clean up this political mess because it's crooked stuff. It's crooked stuff. And it's got to stop. And it's very unfair to people who go out and do it the way you're supposed to do it, including me. I think I'm the only one that's self-funding. I'm the only one putting up my own money, other than, I know it's precious, people write in to DonaldJTrump.com or whatever and they send me checks like $20. I keep saying the woman for $7.50, $50, $100. I don't want their money. But if you send it back it's totally insulting. I mean, they always write letters too. They write these beautiful letters,"Mr. Trump, I can't afford much and I know you don't need it but I'm sending $50 because that's so important what you're saying about the country." It's beautiful. I mean, I've seen such beautiful letters. And if I send it back, there's no letter I can write that's not going to be insulting to those people, really. "Dear Mr. So and So or Mrs. So and So, I don't need your money and thanks a lot but we're going to do it ourselves." If I got that back, I'd say "Who the hell does he think he is?" So we take that and it's something that I think is important. So I always preface it by saying I don't consider that funding but I'm self-funding my campaign and I'm getting ready to put up millions, millions. And something I'm very proud of that I think it's great and it's you know really great, it hasn't gotten very much publicity, hasn't gotten much publicity, but I have spent less money than any other candidate. Okay? By far. I think. I don't know, probably a couple of guys that have nothing so they just go aroundBut I was told that I spend less. And I have the best results because in most polls I'm number one. Now, until Iowa came along, I said "every poll", and then Iowa, what the hell are you people doing to me? You know? You know? I'm telling you. They said, "Why don't you skip Iowa?" They told me that. Everybody said "Skip Iowa". All of the political geniuses. A man just interviewed me back there, great reporter. He's actually a great reporter. Of course, if he writes a bad story, I won't say that. But he is. He's a great reporter. And he said, "Would you ever think of maybe skipping Iowa going right to New Hampshire? And then you'd go to South Carolina" where I'm leading by massive, yeah, you've got to see the rallies there. They're incredible. "But you'd go to New Hampshire. You'd go to South Carolina. You go to Nevada. You go to the SCC." I said I can't do that because I have such an unbelievable relationship with the people from Iowa that I think we're going to win. I really do. I believe it. I believe it. And I don't want to skip Iowa. I think we're going to do well. I think we're going to do great with evangelicals. I think a lot of things are going to come out over the next period of time that are not going to be so good for our opponents, honestly, and I think I'm going to do great with the evangelicals because I am the real deal. I will tell you that. I'm the real deal. So I told these political pros, you know, I hate to say it but the last long number of elections on the Republican circuit, the person that won Iowa did not get the nomination. Okay? I want to take away some of your muster. You understand that. So could we do, and please do me a favor? Let me win Iowa. And then I'm going to win, I'm telling you we're going to win New Hampshire, and we're going to win South Carolina. A great poll just came out on North Carolina just a little while. A PPP poll. It was great. Some of you saw that. But great poll. But we're going to go on and we're going to win. We're going to win. And actually, one of the pundits, because you have some smart pundits and some very, very dumb pundits. A lot of pundits said "He'll never run. He's not going to run." They're still trying to recover. But one of the very smart one says "If Trump wins Iowa, it's over." It's interesting because it will go right through because everywhere else is so great. And I thought it was good here. Come on. Okay, so that's the end of that. But I want to tell you, will you, I refuse to say "Get your asses in gear." I will not say that. I will not say it. I will not say it because I don't want to use anything that's even a little bit off. So will you please do me a favor and work with my people and go out on Feb. 1stand vote and give us a victory? And if I win Iowa, we're going to run the whole table and we are going to make such great deals and we're going to have such a great military and we're going to take care of our health care without that crazy Obamacare that's a nightmare. So, I'm sticking with you people. I'm going to spend money here. I have a great team over here. And I will tell you I'm going to spend a lot of time here and I really want to win Iowa and I think we should and it's so important. And you know, it's about time that Iowa could have a victory and let that person go onto a total victory. Okay? Not like over the last, right? So, I love you all. I mean, we're having fun. But I love you all. But I do mean it. I'm going to stay here. We're going to work really hard. When I heard the poll today, they said "What are you going to do?" I said, "I'm going to work harder in Iowa." I'm not leaving Iowa. I'm not leaving Iowa. Now, if I lose Iowa, I will never speak to you people again. That I can tell you. Okay, let's do a couple of questions. Right? Come on. So, we're going to be discussing something so important for our country, for our economy, and for getting us all working again and working well again. It's a tax reform that I think will make America strong and great again. Too few Americans are working. Too many jobs are being shipped overseas. And too many middle income families cannot make ends meet. This plan directly meets these challenges and the challenges also of business. It will provide major tax relief for middle income and for most other Americans. There will be a major tax reduction. It will simplify the tax code. It will grow the American economy at a level it hasn't seen for decades. And all of this does not add to our debt or our deficit. But I will also be discussing some of that at the end because we have to make much better deals, we have to negotiate much harder, and we've got to make our economy strong. Changes for individuals will be at levels that you haven't seen in a long time. We're going to cut the individual rates from 7 brackets to 4. Simplification. 25%, 20%, 10%, and 0%. If you're single and earn less than $25,000 per year or married and jointly earn less than $50,000,so, very important. If you're single and earn less than $25,000 or married and jointly earn less than $50,000, you'll not pay any income tax, nothing. This eliminates very strongly and quickly the marriage penalty. Very unfair penalty. It eliminates the AMT, which is the alternative minimum tax. It ends the death tax. It's a double taxation. A lot of families go through hell over the death tax. It reduces or eliminates most of the deductions and loopholes available to special interests or to the very rich, in other words, it's going to cost me a fortune, which is actually true, while preserving charitable giving and mortagage interest deductions. Very importantly. It ends the current tax treatment of carried interest. Those are the hedge fund folks that I've been talking about for quite a while. They make a lot of money. Carried interest. So it ends the current tax treatment of carried interest through speculative partnerships that do not grow businesses or create jobs and are not risking their own capital. Changes for business, now, so important, because it's all about business. It's all about jobs. We have 93 million people in this country that are in serious trouble, that want to work; they can't work. So for business, no business of any size from a Fortune 500 company to a mom and pop shop to a freelancer living from gig to gig will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes. Big reduction. A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at significantly discount which coming back at a significantly discount,10%. So it comes back discounted at a 10% tax rate and ends the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad. Now, it's called corporate inversion. It's a huge subject. I've been watching politicians now for years, all talk, no action politicians. I've been watching them for years talking about bringing this money back. The number is probably $2.5 trillion. Everybody agrees it should come back, Republicans, Democrats, everybody. They can't make a deal. They don't know how to go about making a deal. The reason companies aren't bringing it back is the tax is onerous. It doesn't make sense to bring it back. And in fact, many companies are leaving the United States. They're leaving our shores to go and collect their money. They're going actually moving out of the United States for two reasons, the taxes are too high and because they have tremendous amounts of money that they can't bring back into this country when everybody wants them to bring it back in. It's called leadership. We will have that money brought back in. As an example, I have millions of dollars overseas. I can't bring it back into this country. We filed papers. We've been doing this for a year and a half. We can't get it back in. So the money stays in other countries and that's what happens. Not good for us. The level of leadership that we need to get things like this done is so important. But this is something, and I've been watching it for a long time, everybody agrees to. We also reduce or eliminate some business loopholes, many of them actually, and deductions made unnecessary or redundant by the new lower tax rate on business income. The tax rate now is so low that a lot of these deductions which are complicated, which don't make sense, and which are unfair are gone. And we phase in a reasonable cap on the deductability of the business interest expense. So we are going to give you, we have a very complex set of papers that actually if you know business is not so complex. And we're going to hand them out right now to the press. And I think you'll see we have an amazing code. It will be simple. It will be easy. It will be fair. It's graduated. As you get up in income, you pay a little more. Some of the very unfair deductions that certain people have been given who make a lot of money will not be available any longer. But I actually believe they'll do better because I think the economy will grow. It will grow rapidly. And we'll have something very special. Now, with all of that being said and before we take some questions, we have to cut the costs of what's going on in this country. If you look at what we're doing and the money we're spending. I read where a washer, you know what a washer is? Nuts, bolts, and washer, to send from one state to another, it was a 19 set washer and it cost $900,000 and some odd dollars to send it from here to there. And there are many examples. Hammers that cost $800 that you can buy in the store for a tiny amount of money. We will run this country properly. There is so much money to be saved. We're reducing taxes but at the same time if I win, if I become President, we will be able to cut so much money and have a better country. We won't be losing anything other than we'll be balancing budgets and getting them where they should be. So, this is a plan that's simple, that's a major reduction. I think people are going to be very happy. We've already had some very good reviews. I did the plan with some of the leading scholars and economists and tax experts that there are in this country. They love it; they say "Why hasn't this been done before?" And this is my wheelhouse. That's what I do well. The economy is what I do well. Whenever they do polls, I always come out way above everybody else on the economy and on leadership, by the way, but I won't say that. So, if anybody has, thank you. That's amazing. That's some of the press was actually clapping. I've never saw, I don't think I've ever seen that before. All right. Why don't we take some questions from the press?
